Donald has gotten a lot of people to talk about\n                public policy. Perhaps not always in the most levelheaded state\n                but the dialogue has taken place. For some this is the first\n                time that they have discussed international or domestic policies\n                amongst their peers. Until recently conversations about policies\n                have not seen this level of emotional investment. Dialogue so\n                heated that is often reserved for which state has the best high\n                school football or whom Cindy should choose on this season of\n                The Bachelorette.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                The first step in having these conversations effectively is\n                getting people to the table. By bringing more people to the\n                conversation this provides a more accurate representation of the\n                general population. This is something that Donald has been able\n                to do regardless of your political viewpoint. However, these\n                conversations have not always been held in the most peaceful\n                manner. I’m hopefully that the terrible things that have taken\n                place during this election process will show people the need to\n                effectively communicate in less hostile ways. This will become\n                increasingly important with the amount of communication tools on\n                the rise.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                The political disruption that Donald has caused has led to some\n                Republicans turning their back on the party but has also\n                galvanized new members. His presence has also strengthened the\n                support of the Democratic Party. I hope that the individuals on\n                both sides will view issues with their own perspective rather\n                than a blind loyalty to a political party or a lobbyist\n                purchasing their public policy influence.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                When these public policy or election decisions are made with\n                clouded judgment the end result puts the public at risk because\n                of the lack of follow through. These campaign promises we are\n                often sold that are suppose to transform communities lack\n                commitment and commitment is what turns a promise into a\n                reality. Accountability has historically been a speaking point\n                for elections with this year being no different. Unfortunately\n                change often only takes place when a significant event takes\n                place, social media has played a large role in the rise of\n                accountability. Perhaps this is the next event that enables us\n                to begin having legitimate discussions about accountability?\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Regardless whether you love or hate him, he has gotten not only\n                people in the U.S. but globally talking more about public\n                policies, so thank you Donald.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                On an unrelated note I recently purchased a one-way ticket out\n                of the U.S. to…\n              </p>\n              <center>\n                <iframe\n                  width=\"560\"\n                  height=\"315\"\n                  src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RDrfE9I8_hs\"\n                  title=\"YouTube video player\"\n                  frameborder=\"0\"\n                  allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n                  allowfullscreen\n                ></iframe>\n              </center>\n            </Description>\n          </Card>\n        </CardContainerr>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Trump;\n\nconst Card = styled.div`\n  width: 100%;\n\n  border: gold;\n  padding: 10px;\n  margin-right: 30%;\n  margin-left: 30%;\n  background-color: black;\n`;\n\nconst Description = styled.div`\n  padding: 2%;\n  color: white;\n`;\n\nconst CardContainerr = styled.div`\n  display: flex;\n`;\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/2-pic.dbcccd6a.jpeg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/3-pic.905f1fd9.jpeg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/5-pic.a2259466.jpeg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/img_0448.4dd53a14.jpeg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/img_0544.9559ee8b.jpeg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/img_7489.57a18e59.jpeg\";","import styled from \"styled-components\";\nimport huddle from \"./img/2-pic.jpeg\";\nimport dinner from \"./img/3-pic.jpeg\";\nimport lunch from \"./img/5-pic.jpeg\";\nimport familymart from \"./img/img_0448.jpeg\";\nimport field from \"./img/img_0544.jpeg\";\nimport factory from \"./img/img_7489.jpeg\";\n\nfunction Cya() {\n  return (\n    <section id=\"skills\" style={{ backgroundColor: \"black\" }}>\n      <div>\n        <CardContainerr>\n          <Card>\n            <Description>\n              <h1>See You Next Time</h1>\n              <p>May 16, 2016</p>\n              <p>My Cultural Journey and International Relations</p>\n              <img width=\"460px\" src={familymart} />\n              <p>\n                &ldquo;Only those who risk going too far can possibly find out\n                how far they can go&rdquo;- T.S Elliot\n              </p>\n              <p></p>\n              <p>\n                I think this quote does a good job of explaining why I decided\n                to embark on this journey 9 months ago. When I left the States\n                last summer I was unsure as to where I would be living other\n                than that it would be somewhere in China. Living abroad is\n                something that I have wanted to do, this fellowship combined my\n                athletic background and helped build the foundation of my\n                professional career. Asia but China more specifically is a place\n                that can open the mind of an individual and alter their global\n                perception given a positive attitude. As a member of the\n                inaugural class, the fellowship aligned with my decisions\n                throughout life centered on my goals of being in an environment\n                with others who value travel and different cultures.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                Throughout my life I have been passionate about contributing\n                cultural understanding to those around me by using my knowledge\n                from my academic career and personal experiences. I had hoped\n                that this fellowship would enrich my current education and\n                career experiences while giving me an opportunity to promote\n                cultural understanding in China through the game of American\n                Football, which opened up many opportunities for me in my life.\n                In essence, this fellowship abled me to build on the life\n                changing experience I previously had while studying abroad in\n                China and continued to build a solid foundation for my\n                professional career. Likewise, by continuing my cultural\n                education this fellowship abled me to spread my newfound insight\n                and knowledge to further educate people around me.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                My time abroad established a solid foundation for my career so\n                that others may view me as someone that is willing to take\n                calculated risks for personal and professional growth by\n                spending extensive time abroad in an emerging economic power\n                such as China. I&rsquo;m hopeful that China will continue to be\n                featured in my future plans weather I continue to live abroad or\n                return for business. I am confident that I will return to China,\n                it is just a matter of when and for how long.\n              </p>\n              <p></p>\n              <p>IDENTITY</p>\n              <img width=\"460px\" src={lunch} />\n              <p>\n                My understanding of identifying myself as an American has\n                changed so that I am more appreciative of the freedoms that we\n                have as Americans that are often taken for granted. It made me\n                believe even more that as Americans, we should take full\n                advantage of the power of our passports and ability to travel in\n                comparison to other countries. My time in China increased my\n                feelings that Americans need to spend time abroad so that we do\n                not lose our ability to relate to the rest of the world.\n                Hopefully, my time abroad will inspire friends and family to\n                become more knowledgeable of other cultures and prevent them\n                from asking some of the silly questions I received living\n                abroad. Chinese could easily use the limited internet access and\n                passport restrictions as an excuse for some of the benign, yet\n                racial comments they make. In some cases, however, I met people\n                that knew more about America then I did. The large population of\n                China has taught me not to confuse a few situations with a\n                generalization, which is how most stereotypes start.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                My understanding of Asia has changed showing not only the vast\n                differences in the region, but the many nuances within China.\n                Although I spent most of my time in Zhuhai, I was able to\n                explore other Asian countries during the fellowship, and despite\n                spending less time in those countries I was able to pick up on\n                some cultural differences. Within China, I was able to travel as\n                well and I begun to understand cultural differences among the\n                many provinces and even in Guangdong.\n              </p>\n              <p></p>\n              <p>WORK</p>\n              <img width=\"460px\" src={factory} />\n              <p>\n                One of the most enjoyable and beneficial opportunities from my\n                work placement was the chance to do factory tours throughout\n                China with my colleagues and the Supply Chain Director of one of\n                our clients. Most people in the States often think of child\n                labor and the many other jokes that come with Chinese factories.\n                The environments I observed for most of these workers was not\n                something that I personal would enjoy living in but I believe\n                would not align with most Americans perceptions. Since these\n                factories are spread out and specialize in various products I\n                was able to visit Chinese cities that many people would have no\n                other reason to visit such as Ningbo, Taizhou and Fuzhou.\n                Although these factories did not fit the common joke among\n                Americans about factory labor I couldn&rsquo;t help but question\n                my perceptions of factory labor. I was curious if this people\n                are happy with the work they&rsquo;re doing but even if they are\n                not is this different from the man or woman making six figures\n                from a job that they unhappy with. I couldn&rsquo;t help but\n                wonder when seeing these people in factories is this something\n                they dreamed for but if not how did it end up like this, a lack\n                of resources or perhaps a limited perspective abled them to see\n                other possibilities for a career. My time in China showed me how\n                many possibilities in life they are so I think this experience\n                put me in a better position by broadening my perspective.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                This thought begun to snowball and got me thinking about those\n                in other countries and even about myself and how my life could\n                have been had I not had my perspective broaden through travel.\n                The living situation of some people that I met in China might\n                not be something I would want for myself. However seeing what\n                might be considered as unfair to somewhere fresh of the plane\n                goes hand in hand with the perspective of an individual within\n                the country and the different expectations of someone abroad or\n                visiting and not fully understanding the culture. There are so\n                many lessons I learned from this experience but the biggest one\n                would be learning more about people and how their aspirations\n                and business ventures affect their interpersonal relationships.\n                Learning more about people in general was one of my biggest\n                takeaways.\n              </p>\n              <p></p>\n              <p>Language Learning</p>\n              <p></p>\n              <p>\n                &ldquo;You must understand that a foreign language is just basic\n                knowledge&rdquo;\n              </p>\n              <p></p>\n              <p>\n                This was a quote that I saw in a museum in Asia, I think it does\n                a good job of conveying the attitude towards language learning\n                of some of the countries that I have visited. Although a fair\n                portion of non-US citizens view it as such a wonderful place\n                this attitude towards language learning is something that I\n                believe as Americans we fall short, perhaps because of the\n                versatility of English. However I believe the knowledge of a\n                foreign language opens up new doors to an individual, not only\n                does it improve someone as a job prospect but enables them to\n                become more cultural understanding and understand the many\n                nuances of other cultures that often get lost in translation.\n              </p>\n              <p></p>\n              <p></p>\n              <p>Football</p>\n              <p></p>\n              <img width=\"460px\" src={field} />\n              <p>\n                The other fellows and I were brought in to help raise the level\n                of the league and a large part of that was player development.\n                Although we haven&rsquo;t reached SEC caliber athletics I have\n                been pleased and excited with the level of growth and\n                appreciation from my players in Guangzhou. Our annual party is\n                something that made me reflect on the growth that not only our\n                team is having as athletes but the individuals as well.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                Having an instant connection with a portion of the local Chinese\n                community is something that I viewed as the most significant\n                from this fellowship. Moving to a new city without knowing\n                anybody is something that can be difficult especially when you\n                factor in a language barrier, cultural differences and with the\n                Chinese community being difficult for foreigners to break into.\n                Having the connection of sport is something that I would compare\n                to the universal language of music and having the credibility of\n                being a former collegiate athlete gave me the ability to\n                effectively command my team in Guangzhou. I was able to harness\n                this connection that grew over time to delve into both modern\n                and historic Chinese culture, this is something that I hold in\n                high regard. I was able to have experiences that may have taken\n                some people years to have living in China or perhaps not at all.\n                These experiences helped me learn more about people in general.\n                Living in a different culture emphasized not only the\n                differences, but also similarities in human behavior.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                Although I believe I had an impact on my team there were\n                definitely obstacles that I had to face like achieving any goal,\n                even more unique obstacles when trying to achieve quality\n                American football in China.\n              </p>\n              <p></p>\n              <p>\n                Some of the biggest things I learned from American football were\n                the aspect of family and discipline. Upon my arrival to\n                Guangzhou I was met with a team that lacked discipline and a\n                feeling of family. American football has taught me how valuable\n                discipline is and how doing the little things right or not can\n                lead to success or to failure. I encouraged players on the team\n                to spend time with each other off the field whether it be eating\n                together or playing video games to help build the family aspect\n                of the team. Given my location in Zhuhai this wasn&rsquo;t\n                something I was able to fully initiate during the week but I\n                would go out with my team after practice for lunch before\n                returning to Zhuhai. This development of a family atmosphere led\n                to more accountability amongst the time and limited the amount\n                of micro managing I had to do compared to the early time in my\n                fellowship. The family atmosphere that I associate with American\n                football pushed me to do things that at the time thought I was\n                incapable of doing but because of the support of my\n                &ldquo;brothers&rdquo; I was able to conquer these obstacles.\n                This was something I witnessed first hand with my time with the\n                Guangzhou Apaches whether it being a player getting over a fear\n                of beating press coverage or studying for their English exam so\n                they can study abroad in the US they were able to beat these\n                obstacles because of their support group.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                During my fellowship I often questioned myself as to my level of\n                impact on the team especially living 2 hours away but my final\n                game with the team all my doubts were removed, seeing the growth\n                of my players on and off the field. Whether it be the player\n                that got over his fear over tackling or the shy player that\n                became more vocal with the team. One of my biggest takeaways\n                from the final game was during most of my time with the team I\n                didn&rsquo;t get the impression that they were having fun\n                playing the game. However in the final game I saw the shift in\n                having fun playing the game of American football and the family\n                aspect of players celebrating together after good plays whether\n                it be shaking hands or slapping each other on the helmet. This\n                game was something that almost did not happen but we were able\n                to organize it as part of the South China Championship Series\n                and I am very glad we did as it provided me with visual evidence\n                of the impact I had on the team.\n              </p>\n              <img width=\"460px\" src={huddle} /> <p>Conclusion</p>\n              <p></p>\n              <p>\n                One the biggest things I valued during this fellowship compared\n                to my previous time in China was the length of stay, which abled\n                me to really delve into the cultural although there is still\n                more to be explored. For those that have traveled around China\n                or have some knowledge about China might understand the many\n                differences within the country. For those that don&rsquo;t know\n                about the level of complexities within the country this can be\n                summed up by people that ask if someone speaks\n                &ldquo;Chinese&rdquo; as appose to do you speak\n                Mandarin/Cantonese? There are many differences among the\n                different provinces in China and language is just one of them,\n                this has been quite interesting to experience first hand.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                My assessment of the China Gridiron Fellowship is positive with\n                there being a lot of potential to be explored. Orientation was\n                one of the most exciting times for me meeting so many people\n                from various industries. This is an aspect that I wish would\n                have been more prevalent during my fellowship but perhaps would\n                have seen more opportunities being in a bigger city. The fellow\n                selection process is something that went smooth and visa runs\n                were fairly easily given my location to Macau. Being immersed\n                for nine months in a culture that&rsquo;s different from my own,\n                there are many key insights and reflections but the biggest is\n                the irony and hypercriticism among people because it appears\n                that they have lost themselves in the presumptions of a superior\n                culture, ideology etc. Overall things were not always perfect,\n                but neither is life and I believe that one cannot have growth\n                without struggle and the bad makes you appreciate the good. I\n                have no regrets, this fellowship was a great experience and\n                something someone else would be very fortunate to experience.\n              </p>\n              <p></p>\n              <img width=\"460px\" src={dinner} />\n              <p>\n                &ldquo;Ones destination is never a place, but a new way of\n                seeing things&rdquo; &ndash; Henry miller\n              </p>\n            </Description>\n          </Card>\n        </CardContainerr>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Cya;\n\nconst Card = styled.div`\n  width: 100%;\n\n  border: gold;\n  padding: 10px;\n  margin-right: 30%;\n  margin-left: 30%;\n  background-color: black;\n`;\n\nconst Description = styled.div`\n  padding: 2%;\n  color: white;\n`;\n\nconst CardContainerr = styled.div`\n  display: flex;\n`;\n","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/img_7709.421b89c9.jpeg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/img_5506.0b7a2a29.jpeg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/img_02231.737720df.jpeg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/img_0179.2ba3ecc9.jpeg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/img_7541.bb94e703.jpeg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/img_7137.7d7f0b4f.jpeg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/img_6806.a5fb96ec.jpeg\";","export default __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/media/gz_stranded.064fad88.jpeg\";","import styled from \"styled-components\";\nimport baijiu from \"./img_7709.jpeg\";\nimport music from \"./img_5506.jpeg\";\nimport practice from \"./img_02231.jpeg\";\nimport banquet from \"./img_0179.jpeg\";\nimport factory from \"./img_7541.jpeg\";\nimport nye from \"./img_7137.jpeg\";\nimport movie from \"./img_6806.jpeg\";\nimport gz from \"./gz_stranded.jpeg\";\n\nfunction Ten() {\n  return (\n    <section id=\"skills\" style={{ backgroundColor: \"black\" }}>\n      <div>\n        <CardContainerr>\n          <Card>\n            <Description>\n              {/* <h3 style={{ display: \"inline\" }}>Responsible Representation</h3> */}\n              {/* <p>\n              I was fortunate to be the Head Coach for China’s 1st team to\n              compete in the USA Football Flag Championship\n            </p> */}\n              <h1>Click Bait Top 10 List Article </h1>\n              <p>March 10, 2016</p>\n              <p>\n                As my time in China comes to a close I begin to reflect on the\n                journey and recount some of the memorable moments that have\n                taken place.

This was compounded during Chinese New Year, a shocking\n                statistic from this year&rsquo;s holiday is around 2.5 billion\n                trips on the road were expected to be taken, along with 332\n                million trips by train and 55 million through the air.

A growing theme\n                from my blog posts is that more people should travel abroad\n                whether it be for work, study abroad or even vacation and if I\n                had to pick one reason why this would be it.

This\n                is part of the reason I&rsquo;m writing these blogs is so that\n                those that may not have the ability to travel for whatever\n                reason they experience some of this to an extent and inspire\n                them to travel when possible.

I&rsquo;m not referring\n                to the countless shops that often switch owners or disappear\n                completely nor am I talking about the numerous\n                &ldquo;green&rdquo; skyscrapers that quickly turn to housing\n                complexes but rather the people.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>IMG_4686</p>\n\n              <p>\n                My first visit to China was May 2013 and comparing the\n                landscape, culture and behavior to now is perhaps something that\n                can only occur in a country with such a large population and\n                swift action by the government set up. The large population has\n                taught me not to confuse a few situations with a generalization,\n                which I believe is how most stereotypes start.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                During my time in Zhuhai I have observed a change in peoples\n                behaviors towards me compared to my initial arrival in August.\n                One being the amount of people that stare at me throughout the\n                day, in the early stages of my time here I would see locals\n                doing 180 degree turns to stare which has now become a lowered\n                degree or not at all as my time increases. Perhaps they confused\n                me with the 4 other black people I have seen in Zhuhai or maybe\n                it&rsquo;s their general curiosity talked about in countless\n                blogs. Whatever the reason may be things are changing&#8230;or\n                maybe I am just getting more use to it. An example of this\n                development is comparing the first time I went to play\n                basketball, I could feel the high expectations being a\n                6&rsquo;4&rdquo; black man and all the expectations that come\n                with that especially in a country where I have been asked a fair\n                amount of silly race related questions. Maybe on some level it\n                was karma for all the Americans that have asked Asian-Americans\n                similar silly race related questions simply by not having a core\n                base of understanding of other cultures.\n              </p>\n\n              <p> </p>\n\n              <p>\n                However after a few games and seeing my low shooting percentage\n                I can&rsquo;t help but feel like I broke some stereotypes\n                (that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m here for right?). Most of the\n                people I have come across who ask these types of questions they\n                are rarely asked with negative intentions, simply stemming from\n                ignorance. Now living in a country that is not as racially\n                diverse as the United States I see how this limited exposure to\n                other cultures leads to the media playing the role of PR for\n                various groups of people. For other foreigners living in or\n                visiting China and wondering what the locals do with all the\n                photos they take of us I think I may have found an\n                answer&#8230;well at least a partial answer &ndash; WeChat.\n              </p>\n\n              <p></p>\n\n              <p>IMG_4651.PNG</p>\n\n              <p></p>\n\n              <p>\n                Surrounding yourself with diverse people forces you to learn\n                more and be open minded, truly seeing people for a person and\n                not a race, gender, class etc. You begin to see that most people\n                deal with the same core issues but perhaps through a different\n                perspective given the perception that others have about someone\n                based on their race, gender, class etc. Traveling has reinforced\n                my perception that things may not be as different as you\n                initially think. A prime example of this is when I was having a\n                conversation with another American living overseas and how his\n                family and friends think his life is soooo much different living\n                abroad. His response, &ldquo;I do the same things here that I\n                would if I was in the States, I work, relax at home and spend\n                time with friends I am just a little farther from home. Things\n                are different yet the same, obviously there are differences in\n                language and food options but at the core things remain the\n                same.&rdquo; During my time here I have spent time at work,\n                bars, festivals and sporting events, all things I probably would\n                have done if I stayed in the States &ndash; seeing children pee\n                on the side of the road and eating balut egg or chicken feet may\n                have not happened.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>IMG_5533.JPG</p>\n\n              <p>IMG_5573</p>\n\n              <p>\n                A larger scale example of the similarities between the two\n                countries is the reference to &ldquo;The American Dream&rdquo;\n                or &ldquo;The Chinese Dream&rdquo;. Growing up in the States I\n                often heard about the American Dream, while people reconsider\n                what this means today I have often heard about the Chinese dream\n                living here. I believe this concept of the dream is changing\n                here as well because the younger generation has more examples of\n                others that were able to make successful careers out of\n                following their passions compared to those of earlier\n                generations.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Below is a conversation between a friend and I that was sparked\n                from some topics in my previous blog&#8230;\n              </p>\n\n              <p></p>\n\n              <p>\n                [I have started to notice more people whether be my age or older\n                that have kind of given up on their search and I am very\n                determined to make sure that I do not become one of those\n                people. ]\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Me too. I think what you see, represents a further break-down of\n                traditional employment. It is one of the great social and\n                economic shifts of our time which affects everyone, not a\n                generational thing.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                During my entire career, I depended on others (recruiters,\n                interviewers, hiring managers) to offer me a job. Now that I\n                have been a contractor for 5 years, I have still depended on\n                recruiters to match me to jobs. The business (Free Agent Source)\n                has grown slowly because neither of us founders are natural\n                sales professionals. Both of us are capable, just didn&rsquo;t\n                formally take on a sales role.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Last year, I finally got angry about my situation. Jobs, gigs,\n                recruiters&#8230; there are gate keepers every step of the way\n                who put themselves in a position of judgment which makes job\n                seekers bend themselves into a pretzel trying to win approval. I\n                snapped. If you can&rsquo;t sell, you will be someone\n                else&rsquo;s &ldquo;bitch&rdquo;. And I really mean it in that\n                way. It means if we can&rsquo;t get our own work, we will be\n                dependent on someone else to find work for us, which gives them\n                more power in the relationship. And in most cases (I&rsquo;d say\n                7 people out of 10) those people who bring us work will exploit\n                that relationship, use it to their advantage.\n              </p>\n\n              <p></p>\n\n              <p>\n                This is just one representation of the many conversations I have\n                had centered around this concept so I ask you this, what is your\n                DREAM?\n              </p>\n\n              <p></p>\n\n              <p>\n                My time traveling has let me see what is possible and truly how\n                many options there are, my recommendation is to decide on a\n                fulfilling goal and don&rsquo;t forget to enjoy the journey\n                along the way.\n              </p>\n\n              <p></p>\n\n              <p></p>\n\n              <p>\n                Travel matters not because of the places you&rsquo;ll go and the\n                things you&rsquo;ll do.

I met wonderful new people and ate delicious food\n                while continuing to shape my global perspective. As I approached\n                CMH airport I began my journey without a complete itinerary I\n                couldn&rsquo;t help but be excited for the things to come and\n                the opportunity to bridge the cultural gap between Chinese\n                people and Americans. Six months ago I decided to move to the\n                other side of the world while being unsure as to where I would\n                live after my initial month in Shanghai. I now live in Zhuhai in\n                China&rsquo;s southern Guangdong province, along the way I made\n                a few stops to get the most out of the move.\n              </p>\n\n              <p></p>\n\n              <p>IMG_6559</p>\n\n              <p>IMG_6285Zhuhai, China</p>\n\n              <p></p>\n\n              <p>IMG_2185.JPG Los Angeles, U.S.A.</p>\n\n              <p>PA242786 (1).JPG</p>\n\n              <p>Kyoto, Japan</p>\n\n              <p>IMG_2697.JPG Bangkok, Thailand</p>\n\n              <p>IMG_3733.JPG Phuket, Thailand</p>\n\n              <p>IMG_3709.JPG Phi Phi Islands, Thailand</p>\n\n              <p>IMG_4294</p>\n\n              <p>Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia</p>\n\n              <p></p>\n\n              <p>OLYMPUS DIGITAL CAMERAIMG_4680 Shanghai, China</p>\n\n              <p>IMG_4899.PNG</p>\n\n              <p>Hangzhou, China</p>\n\n              <p></p>\n\n              <p>IMG_5525 Guangzhou, China</p>\n\n              <p>IMG_5711</p>\n\n              <p>Boracay, Philippines</p>\n\n              <p>Also&#8230;</p>\n\n              <p>\n                Macau &ndash; Hong Kong &ndash; San Francisco &ndash; Vancouver\n                &ndash; Atlanta &ndash; Shenzhen\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                I was able to take away something from every destination whether\n                big or small but something that always stuck with me regardless\n                of the place was what I would experience at the airport in these\n                locations. The desire that people in the airport have to make a\n                connection with those around them is something that I have only\n                seen inside airports and briefly at my time in hostels. Perhaps\n                this attitude stems from the desire to remain within in their\n                comfort level while physically being detached from their life at\n                home. Moving to the other side of the world with all my personal\n                belongings made me reevaluate this concept of home&#8230;\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Seeing how an environment shapes an individuals thought process\n                and actions by being in diverse company but also being in\n                situations you may have never been in breeds an evolution in\n                ones thought process. The hypocrisy that I am beginning to see\n                in the world as each journey leads to a fuller view of the world\n                is part funny and part sad given the common conflicts and\n                misunderstandings that take place. At a time in the U.S. when\n                Muslims are not welcomed by some I had the opportunity to learn\n                more about their religion while in Malaysia, visit mosques and\n                hear about some of the mistreatment my friends received during\n                their time in the States. I could not help but think that they\n                and their friends had many more stories to share explaining\n                moments of discomfort whether on purpose or incidentally simply\n                from a lack of understanding. There are a lot of pictures that\n                can be painted by the media and or your friends &ndash;\n                it&rsquo;s a big world and many angles to view it &ndash; so go\n                experience it for yourself and develop your own perspective.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                A large part of my solo traveling is making new friends, which\n                is not ideal for an introverted person like myself but becomes\n                easier with the redundancy of typical conversations.\n                &ldquo;Where are you from?&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;How long are\n                you here?&rdquo; &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;\n                &ldquo;Do you like it?&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;Are you going to\n                stay?&rdquo; etc. The ability to truly enjoy the moment with\n                most of these people constantly coming in and out of my life\n                I&rsquo;ve learned to value the good that comes my way and enjoy\n                something for what it is. I consider myself a very private\n                person and for every person that invades my personal space in\n                the overcrowded public transit there is a moment of joy I have\n                for the person studying English uses me as a real life situation\n                to chant out &ldquo;helloooo&rdquo;. For every person I meet\n                that has something negative to say about another person,\n                country, food etc. there is someone that has something positive\n                to say. These types of situations are something that can only be\n                experienced by exposing yourself to a large diverse group of\n                people. This is why I try to encourage people to travel whenever\n                they can &ndash; not only for the fancy picture they can put on\n                their Instagram or not even solely for the food&#8230;but for\n                the people you meet and the new perspective you develop by being\n                open to new experiences. Living in China there are many things\n                that could frustrate you but like most things, your attitude\n                towards the situation alters your experience.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Being a recent graduate and entering the workforce something\n                that has been on my mind often during traveling is my perception\n                of work and the lifestyle I wish to have as I grow older. After\n                seeing various lifestyles from the people I went to school with\n                on track with the typical successful career to the people in\n                small villages that seemingly have nothing. Travel has forced me\n                to question and formulate my own definition of success &ndash; I\n                want the ability to do what I want (doesn&rsquo;t everybody?).\n                Graduating from university and hearing about many of my peers\n                being uneasy about their future especially when comparing their\n                life to often portrayed glamorous lives of their peers on social\n                media.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want a million dollars, you want the\n                lifestyle you think having a million dollars will get you&rdquo;\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                The constant reevaluation of what I already know is just one of\n                the many things I enjoy about travel. The crazy things keep you\n                on your toes and teach you not to take things so serious while\n                finding the joy in the bad.\n              </p>\n\n              <p></p>\n\n              <p>\n                &ldquo;One&rsquo;s destination is never a place, but a new way\n                of seeing things&rdquo; &ndash; Henry Miller\n              </p>\n            </Description>\n          </Card>\n        </CardContainerr>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Normal;\n\nconst Card = styled.div`\n  width: 100%;\n\n  border: gold;\n  padding: 10px;\n  margin-right: 30%;\n  margin-left: 30%;\n  background-color: white;\n`;\n\nconst Description = styled.div`\n  padding: 2%;\n  color: black;\n`;\n\nconst CardContainerr = styled.div`\n  display: flex;\n`;\n","import About from \"./About\";\nimport Projects from \"./Projects\";\nimport Culture from \"./Culture\";\n\nexport function Home() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <About />\n      <Projects />\n      <Culture />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Home;\n","import styled from \"styled-components\";\n\nfunction Pain() {\n  return (\n    <section id=\"skills\" style={{ backgroundColor: \"black\" }}>\n      <div>\n        <CardContainerr>\n          <Card>\n            <Description>\n              <h1>No Pain No Gain </h1>\n              <p>\n                During this bootcamp and in preparation I have spent many hours\n                on my laptop. Due to this increased time on the computer I begun\n                to develop some pain in my wrist, hand and fingers. This was\n                troubling for me and forced me to walk the fine line between the\n                curiosity of trying to figure out what was going on and the\n                scary search results from using WebMD.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                The website below talks more about conditions but I have and\n                will continue to refrain from diagnosing myself through\n                webpages.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>https://ada.com/conditions/repetitive-strain-injury/</p>\n\n              <p>\n                One of the things that I came across that may be causing this\n                pain was colder weather which made sense to me as I made the\n                transition from California to Ohio during winter while I\n                complete this program. Another potential factor may be the lack\n                of physical activity for me over the past year as most gyms have\n                been closed. Although the pain still remains I have found some\n                things that have been useful for me and hopefully they can help\n                you alleviate discomfort.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Initially I was trying to shrug off this pain as something that\n                was insignificant coming from a physical career the thought that\n                computer programming could take a toll on my body seemed\n                laughable but minor adjustments have proved beneficial.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                In recent weeks I have tried to increase my physical activity\n                &ndash; getting back into ice hockey, yoga and hopefully pickup\n                basketball when the weather warms up and more vaccines get\n                distributed.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                In addition to these lifestyle changes I found some material\n                things that have made my programming life easier &ndash; I would\n                also suggest investing in a better chair than the one I have\n                been using&#8230;\n              </p>\n\n              <p> Putty link</p>\n\n              <p> Mouse link</p>\n\n              <p> Dr teals salt</p>\n\n              <p>\n                {\" \"}\n                In addition to these items I utilized my annual eye exam\n                courtesy of my previous employer and found out that I needed\n                glasses and opted for a pair with a blue light filter that has\n                also helped me in this new career path.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                I&rsquo;m always impressed by people that know all the best\n                tricks for efficiency and I have been trying to incorporate all\n                types of shortcuts, strategies etc. to optimize my time as a\n                computer programmer.

Prior to my recent coding\n                bootcamp I would view this ability as something magical or that\n                it should just happen but I have now become more investigative\n                into the inner works of technology.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Chromecast gets things to your TV screen from a remote device in\n                part by using something called the DIAL (Discovery And Launch)\n                protocol. DIAL was developed jointly by Netflix and YouTube,\n                which is owned by Google. DIAL actually launched on Google TV,\n                Google&rsquo;s earlier foray into TV control, and now it&rsquo;s\n                being integrated into devices and apps by a number of\n                manufacturers and content providers.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                One of Chromecast&rsquo;s components, the DIAL Service Discovery\n                protocol, uses Simple Service Discovery Protocol (SSDP) version\n                1.1, which is defined by UPnP (Universal Plug and Play), to\n                allow a DIAL client device to locate a DIAL server device\n                running on the same network. The other component, the DIAL REST\n                (Representational State Transfer) Service, is then accessed to\n                query, launch or stop applications using HTTP (Hypertext\n                Transfer Protocol) requests from the client device to the server\n                device. In the case of Chromecast, your phone, tablet or\n                computer is the client and the Chromecast itself is the server.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Google created Google Cast screen-sharing technology to work on\n                top of DIAL, adding a lot more functionality than DIAL could\n                offer alone. It developed the Google Cast SDK (Software\n                Development Kit) to enable developers to add related\n                functionality to third-party apps that can be used to launch\n                media from the client device to the Chromecast. There are Google\n                Cast APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) for each\n                compatible operating system. All this allows for functionality\n                such as pausing and volume control, as well as additional\n                features that app developers are free to implement.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                The Chromecast is actually running a pared-down version of the\n                Chrome browser, and the applications on the device are Web\n                applications that receive the aforementioned HTTP requests and\n                react accordingly. Once the app is launched, it will actually be\n                running on the Chromecast, but a communication channel will be\n                open that allows the client device to act as a sort of remote\n                control. This dynamic allows you to turn off your mobile device\n                without stopping whatever is streaming from the Chromecast to\n                your TV.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                To set up Chromecast, you have to either install a special app\n                or a Chrome extension, depending upon what device you&rsquo;re\n                using as a media launcher. Once it&rsquo;s set up, you use\n                third-party apps like Netflix, YouTube or the Chrome browser to\n                do the actual launching and controlling of your content.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                {\" \"}\n                Screen casting differs from screen mirroring in two ways. When\n                you&rsquo;re casting to another display, you&rsquo;re not\n                mirroring the screen of your device. You can cast a video to\n                another display and still use your device, often a phone or\n                tablet, without interrupting the video or showing any of your\n                other content. When you cast content from your phone to a TV,\n                you will no longer see the content on your phone. It will only\n                appear on the TV.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Additionally, the content is not played from your phone or\n                tablet. The device connected to the display (Google&rsquo;s\n                Chromecast, for example) downloads and plays the content on the\n                TV. Once you have screen cast the content to the TV, you will\n                need to control it from the TV and not your phone or personal\n                device.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                The term &ldquo;casting&rdquo; as it is currently used grew in\n                popularity largely after the launch of Chromecast, and it\n                quickly became the standard term for playing content on your TV\n                from an app on your mobile device. Google&rsquo;s Chromecast is\n                one of the most popular streaming devices that is capable of\n                casting and can be built into any number of apps.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                When you send content to your Chromecast, the device loads a\n                special lightweight webpage using HTML5, Javascript, and CSS.\n                It&rsquo;s not the same web page that you would view if you were\n                using the sites web application. This webpage then loads the\n                content using the HTML5 tag and waits for commands such as\n                pausing, fast forwarding and rewinding.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                For now, Google has restrictions on who can use their Cast API\n                and what apps are created with it. Developers must first get\n                approval by Google to use and access the API and have their\n                Chromecast device approved for development. Next, they have to\n                get written approval from Google before their apps will run on\n                Chromecast devices. It seems Google wants to maintain a healthy\n                user experience by keeping a watchful eye over Chromecast apps.\n                If you&rsquo;re a developer interested in the Google Cast API,\n                you can get started by requesting access here. In fact, it seems\n                you can add support to your existing application with less than\n                200 lines of code.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                The second method bypasses the Google Cast API and allows you to\n                project web content to your Chromecast through a Chrome web\n                browser tab. You do this by installing the Google Cast extension\n                for Chrome on your computer. This method, while will be\n                extremely popular until more applications are built using the\n                above method, will yield different results for different people\n                depending on their computer speed. When you&rsquo;re casting or\n                mirroring a webpage using the extension, the Chromecast loads\n                your current webpage using an HTML5 standard called WebRTC. If\n                you&rsquo;ve heard of WebRTC before, you normally would\n                associate it with video chatting. That&rsquo;s still\n                what&rsquo;s going on here, basically. Your computer essentially\n                video chats or streams a video of the current tab in Chrome over\n                to the Chromecast. The video is constantly encoding and\n                transmitting. This is why you need a powerful computer. If your\n                computer and network can&rsquo;t handle a higher bit-rate, the\n                extension allows you to choose between 480p, 720p, and a higher\n                bit-rate 720p to adjust accordingly.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Chromecast uses a lightweight Chrome OS along with the standard\n                web technologies of HTML5, WebRTC, APIs and Chrome extensions.\n                It seems at least for now, Google wants to provide a great user\n                experience by keeping a watchful eye over new Chromecast\n                applications. Hopefully after reading this you will have a\n                greater appreciation of the technology that goes into the\n                conveniences that casting provides.\n              </p>\n            </Description>\n          </Card>\n        </CardContainerr>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Mirror;\n\nconst Card = styled.div`\n  width: 100%;\n\n  border: gold;\n  padding: 10px;\n  margin-right: 30%;\n  margin-left: 30%;\n  background-color: black;\n`;\n\nconst Description = styled.div`\n  padding: 2%;\n  color: white;\n`;\n\nconst CardContainerr = styled.div`\n  display: flex;\n`;\n","import styled from \"styled-components\";\n\nfunction Fined() {\n  return (\n    <section id=\"skills\" style={{ backgroundColor: \"black\" }}>\n      <div>\n        <CardContainerr>\n          <Card>\n            <Description>\n              <h1>\n                &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Just Here So I Won&rsquo;t Get Fined&rdquo;\n              </h1>\n              <p>\n                Feeling It Marshawn Lynch GIF by NFL - Find &amp; Share on GIPHY\n                Diversity and inclusion has become a topic of more conversations\n                in recent years and the tech industry is no different.

Never\n                having a computer class growing up and only recently altering my\n                perspective of a computer from a tool of consumption to a tool\n                of creation left me with a feeling of disappointment.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                There are many factors as to why this problem exists and\n                Marshawn Lynch talks about his childhood experiences and how the\n                perception of career possibilities plays in one&rsquo;s career\n                trajectory.

Although there is merit in finding out a\n                solution by one&rsquo;s self and powering through a problem. The\n                level of efficiency that is required to be successful at certain\n                times lends itself better to reach out and ask for help.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                With the help of many others and a little bit of hard work I\n                have come across some moments of growth where things finally\n                &lsquo;click&rsquo;&#8230;\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                {\" \"}\n                The experiences that Marshawn talked about are some of the very\n                same that underrepresented youth are continuing to deal with.\n                Hearing about his story made me reflect on a recent reading of\n                mine, &ldquo;The Outliers&rdquo; by Malcolm Gladwell where he\n                talks about Bill Gates among many other successful individuals.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                The story of Bill Gates starts when he was an eighth grade\n                student. The mothers group at his school have a bake sale every\n                year. They buy something for the eighth grade class with the\n                proceeds. It just so happened that they bought a PC before they\n                had software. To get the PC to perform required punching holes\n                in a card, then putting the card in the PC. It started working.\n                Gates was obviously consumed and challenged by the process. But\n                keep in mind that he was the only one in his class who became a\n                household name. He kept with it until he couldn&rsquo;t go any\n                further. That was in his sophmore year in high school. It turns\n                out that University of Washington, conveniently was across the\n                street from high school, had the next level computer he needed.\n                There he met Paul Allen who became his partner 4 years later. No\n                doubt that Gates had an extraordinary aptitude for programming\n                and software development. However a few things lined up for him,\n                but it was, as Gladwell explains, 10,000 hours of focused hard\n                work on one thing that ultimately led to the tipping point in\n                his career.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Something else that has increased my level of efficiency is\n                watching videos in 2x speed. Initially this was something that\n                seemed odd to me but given the amount of time in a day and the\n                amount of information I have needed to consume I couldn&rsquo;t\n                see doing this program any other way.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Although receiving this information often feels like this&#8230;\n              </p>\n\n              <p> Some of the water(information) will stick, ya gotta&#8230;</p>\n\n              <p>\n                {\" \"}\n                Before the program started I was worried that going through such\n                a rigorous program would diminish my interest in coding.\n                However, I feel like this experience has done the exact\n                opposite, my wrist hurts and I can&rsquo;t remember the last\n                time I had a good night&rsquo;s sleep but this has been\n                something I really have enjoyed. Being in a program that has\n                forced me to learn and implement new technologies in such a\n                short of amount of time will set me up for success in my career.\n                The life cycle of up to date tech is becoming faster and faster\n                I believe having this skill set will be advantageous.

An experience\n                I had with this was trying develop a successful football culture\n                in China. Having to recreate something that is so specific to\n                American culture in a country like China was not an easy feat.\n                Having an understanding of why something could or could not work\n                allowed me to thrive internationally by knowing what would\n                translate and what needed to be tweaked. Without a proper\n                understanding as to why or why not something works I believe I\n                would not have been as successful.

I often found myself\n                asking about the location of various items such as measuring\n                spoons, flour, sugar etc. I found myself reminiscing on the\n                effective communication from our &ldquo;what the fluff?&rdquo;\n                cohort. When I was often given directions such as its over there\n                by the fridge or next to that other mysterious object in a vague\n                location I became even more grateful of the clear communication\n                of my pairing partners.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Ultimately, the goal is to produce the requested deliverables\n                and clear communication is essential when asking for those\n                deliverables and even more so when pair programming is involved.\n                Being able to get a message across by identifying a code block\n                within the line numbers of a file or differentiate enumerable\n                types is beneficial during pair programming.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                The importance of effective communication when pair programming\n                has become even more apparent as we conclude Phase 1 of our\n                bootcamp and projects become more complex.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                At times when what you are looking at looks like\n                this&#8230;&#8230;\n              </p>\n\n              <p> &#8230;and makes you feel like this&#8230;</p>\n\n              <p>\n                {\" \"}\n                You really begin to appreciate clear and direct communication as\n                you sort through your code and produce deliverables.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                {\" \"}\n                Special shoutout to my wonderful partner Jennifer Tracy as we\n                have recently completed our Phase 1 project &ndash; check it out\n                below!\n              </p>\n\n              <p>https://github.com/jtray86/date-night</p>\n\n              <p>\n                {\" \"}\n                &ldquo;Communication works for those who work at it.&rdquo;\n              </p>\n\n              <p>John Powell</p>\n            </Description>\n          </Card>\n        </CardContainerr>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default PairProgramming;\n\nconst Card = styled.div`\n  width: 100%;\n\n  border: gold;\n  padding: 10px;\n  margin-right: 30%;\n  margin-left: 30%;\n  background-color: black;\n`;\n\nconst Description = styled.div`\n  padding: 2%;\n  color: white;\n`;\n\nconst CardContainerr = styled.div`\n  display: flex;\n`;\n","import styled from \"styled-components\";\nimport React from \"react\";\n\nfunction ThankYou() {\n  return (\n    <section id=\"skills\" style={{ backgroundColor: \"black\" }}>\n      <div>\n        <CardContainerr>\n          <Card>\n            <Description>\n              <center>\n                <h1> Thank You</h1>\n                <h4>October 17, 2017</h4>\n              </center>\n              <p>\n                I have recently had some time to reflected on the past couple\n                years and wanted to thank those that have helped me reach the\n                point I am at today. As I’m in the early stages of a career and\n                experiencing the “real world” I am able to recall specific\n                people and events that have dramatically impacted my life for\n                the better. I got my first passport May 2013, just prior to my\n                study abroad tour and since then I have spent about half of my\n                time outside of the U.S. – this would have never been possible\n                without the inspiration of a summer trip to Hawaii in 2010.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                Developing and having a study abroad experience was insightful,\n                it provided an opportunity to reap the rewards of perseverance\n                towards achieving a goal fueled by passion while shifting my\n                worldview. Many of my recent accomplishments can be attributed\n                to things I learned abroad or during that summer of 2010. Most\n                recently the ability to remain flexible, open-minded and\n                decision making without fear of taking the path less traveled.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                Growing up I was never one of those kids knew exactly what they\n                wanted to be when they grew up and perhaps like some other\n                people they’re still trying to figure it out. However I knew\n                there was something I didn’t want, a predictable 9-5 office job,\n                being someone that becomes agitated with routine and spending\n                extensive time inside staring at a screen.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                Recognizing the pivotal moments and decisions that have led me\n                to where I am today leave me very grateful and appreciative for\n                those that have and continue to help me along the way.\n                Understanding the impact of these moments and using these\n                collective experiences as my guide to make decisions both\n                professional and personal has proven to be effective. These\n                moments being the core of what led me to my current opportunity,\n                spending extensive time abroad and helping others achieve what\n                they hope for through athletics.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                Having a career that allows me to help individuals both youth\n                and adults to progress as more well rounded people is something\n                that I have and continue to enjoy. My time abroad has let me see\n                what is possible and truly how many options there are so that I\n                can pursue a fulfilling goal, while enjoying the journey along\n                the way.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                When there’s one moment one decision that affected your life in\n                such an impactful way you can really step back and cherish the\n                moment. Going from not even having a passport a few years ago to\n                one where the front printing has been completely removed from\n                use and a laissez-faire attitude.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                Traveling is a plus not only for cool photos that strike envy\n                into friends and family but for reading history and seeing\n                things on TV that suddenly become more real. Travel will open\n                your mind, your heart and has the capacity to change your life.\n                Just try not to lose your passport!\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                Again, thank you so much for all your help.

Whether it be small things like drinking hot water\n                and considering fruit dessert or larger concepts such as my view\n                on import food or the financial technology industry.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                With the rise of nationalism globally especially in China I\n                begun to self examine what it means to be an American. There is\n                a large difference in the way Chinese people perceive the U.S.\n                in 2013, the first time I visited China verses now.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Being a black American I was drawn to Barack Obama for obvious\n                reasons but specifically his multiracial background and how his\n                experiences in Asia affected him. Being removed from American\n                culture for an extended period of time I begun to observe things\n                that are exclusive or are often associated with the U.S.,\n                something as simple as baseball caps or Americans love of\n                acronyms.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                These are both things that I enjoy as well, but I never\n                considered myself a patriotic person, owning American Flag\n                apparel or whatever that means to you. After spending this time\n                as an expat I have become more appreciative of things that often\n                go over looked living in the states and the freedoms that come\n                with that. Whether it be being able to use Google and their\n                services, speak freely about the government, having a blog\n                website that doesn’t get blocked or being able to visit a Waffle\n                House.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Not being of Chinese ethnicity I know I would never be Chinese\n                regardless of how long I lived there, someone moving to America\n                may eventually blend because of the many people from diverse\n                racial backgrounds.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>This led me to a specific series of questions…</p>\n\n              <p>What it means to be an American?</p>\n\n              <p>What is American identity to the outside world?</p>\n\n              <p>When do you stop being a foreigner?</p>\n\n              <p>\n                As the role of the U.S. and its influence minimizes in the\n                global setting how will other countries handle filling this\n                power vacuum, quality PR and the benefit of doubt that is often\n                lent to those in positions towards the top.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                With the U.S. being the melting pot that it is why do so many\n                citizens not have a more global perspective when compared to\n                other nations? Is it that these people subscribe to their\n                version of America and remain in their bubble, have forgotten\n                their history or perhaps haven’t had enough international\n                experiences to be curious about other cultures.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                As of late perspectives in America have evolved to be more\n                welcoming of other cultures whether it be the rising popularity\n                of fusion food in America or the 2017 billboard success,\n                Despacito despite not being spoken in English. Expectations of\n                masculinity in the States are something that has also shifted in\n                such a short period of time. When I was younger, things or\n                people were often considered gay if they were disliked or not\n                manly enough. Now these conversations have a much different tone\n                and complexity.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Evolution of communication in culture is something that I have\n                noticed especially when examining the meaning of words and how\n                they evolve through experience. An example of this is learning a\n                new language a you are told the translation word but over time\n                using and hearing that word it begins to develop a slightly\n                different meaning for you as you recall previous moments when it\n                was used. Your experiences shape the way in which you interpret\n                various forms of communication.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Language barriers are not the only thing that lead to\n                miscommunication but also the lack of cultural understanding and\n                aspects associated with a particular language and culture. Slang\n                is the easiest example of this and how people may speak the same\n                language but this difference in cultural expression establishes\n                a disconnect.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                With the increasing number of people from multiracial\n                backgrounds and those being displaced globally the question of\n                identity will become increasingly difficult for the individual\n                but also in how they are viewed.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                “To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you\n                something else is the greatest accomplishment.” Ralph Waldo\n                Emerson\n              </p>\n            </Description>\n          </Card>\n        </CardContainerr>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Amerikkka;\n\nconst Card = styled.div`\n  width: 100%;\n\n  border: gold;\n  padding: 10px;\n  margin-right: 30%;\n  margin-left: 30%;\n  background-color: white;\n`;\n\nconst Description = styled.div`\n  padding: 2%;\n  color: black;\n`;\n\nconst CardContainerr = styled.div`\n  display: flex;\n`;\n","import styled from \"styled-components\";\n\nfunction Nom() {\n  return (\n    <section id=\"skills\" style={{ backgroundColor: \"black\" }}>\n      <div>\n        <CardContainerr>\n          <Card>\n            <Description>\n              <center>\n                <h1> nomMmmmm</h1>\n                <h4>June 26, 2018</h4>\n              </center>\n              <p>\n                Prior moving to China I didn’t think I liked Chinese food,\n                growing up in the Midwest my experience with Chinese food was\n                through assimilated menu items such as sweet sour pork and\n                orange chicken.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                The little things are what make the difference, being abroad and\n                far from the foods that I grew up with I began to learn to cook.\n                Fresh ingredients and slight adjustments in recipes can make a\n                large difference in the taste of a dish as a whole. Slight\n                adjustments in my approach at the market whether it be adding a\n                smile, staying a little longer to speak Mandarin with the local\n                vendors and their children made a large difference. Not only in\n                the discounted vegetables I received on my following visits but\n                also I like to think I had an impact on the people.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>What’s the weirdest food you’ve had?</p>\n\n              <p>\n                I’m often asked this when I return home about my time in Asia,\n                various factors shaped the things I ate based on price and how\n                easy it was to get.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Being in a very different environment from the one I grew up in\n                I had to relearn many simple things. These obstacles compounded\n                by the black experience – hesitant to buy lotion because the\n                possibility of local versions having skin whitening. Pushing\n                past these fears and removing myself from an echo chamber that\n                discourages new food, products, services and experiences allowed\n                me to make the most of my time abroad and have a new perspective\n                returning to the States and or wherever I may end up next.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                As fast as a successful risk taken for a product or service can\n                build confidence to try the next one, a negative can set one\n                back twice as fast.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Successful risks I have taken despite my initial skepticism\n                include things such as mango cheese tea, dragon bean, rambuton\n                and balut – some I continue to enjoy to this day while others\n                provided a single moment of joy. For every mango cheese tea\n                there is a durian that lingers with me and makes me skeptical to\n                try new things – I can’t help but relate this to the attitudes\n                people may have towards others. Being a home body and spending\n                too much at home, perhaps too a fault I leaned on popular food\n                deliver service 美团(meituan), filing for IPO later this year.\n                This service is much more accessible given the low price when\n                compared to the American equivalent of Uber Eats and Postmates.\n                Looking at the global market of food delivery and its connection\n                to the ride sharing services, there is a growing division\n                between East and West. The rise of Asia is undeniable, whether\n                it is Uber being bought out by Didi in China or the manipulation\n                of Uber via investments by Softbank (Japanese) globally.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Food is a part of daily life and through that with trying new\n                dishes and enjoying them you are not only accepting the dish but\n                the people that feel such an attachment to it.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Some of the best meals I’ve had were in places that were off the\n                beaten path.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Break the biases you may have towards a specific drink, dish or\n                cuisine and you may be pleasantly surprised by what you find.\n              </p>\n\n              <iframe\n                width=\"560\"\n                height=\"315\"\n                src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/yGf6LNWY9AI\"\n                title=\"YouTube video player\"\n                frameborder=\"0\"\n                allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n                allowfullscreen\n              ></iframe>\n\n              <p>Where do you draw your line?</p>\n\n              <p>\n                Chances are your cuisine as some similar version of whatever it\n                is you are or are not considering.

Living abroad and traveling I began to realize how\n                experiences shape people and their belief systems. Expanding\n                your bubble lets you immerse yourself in contrasting viewpoints,\n                develop a sense of empathy and a unique perspective. This\n                development has led to a growing obsession with duality and\n                rejection for the excluded middle. The experiences of those in\n                middle America in comparison to those in major coastline cities\n                is drastically different.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                Perspective is something that can be used however you see fit…\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                People often voice their opinion about others that post\n                extremely long FB posts – but how is this any different from\n                these blog posts?\n              </p>\n\n              <p>Maybe it’s different because this has a different URL</p>\n\n              <p>\n                I ease my growing disdain of flying with love for new places,\n                people and the experiences that change my perceptive. Moments of\n                solitude during flights is something that I am beginning to\n                appreciate, providing a disconnect from the Internet that has\n                not been able to be replicated since years of childhood, prior\n                to AIM and MySpace. These moments of introspection are often\n                shared during other modes of transportation. Riding the train\n                back to Shanghai in late March I contemplated my future as what\n                appeared to be a critical moment in my life, reminiscent of\n                making my college decision.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Often times when people are making decisions their perspective\n                becomes shifted and they forget that things are never as big as\n                you think.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Lack of understanding this concept is something that led to\n                flawed decision making during the Spring of 2011. Since then I\n                like to believe that I have made decisions more objectively\n                while not worrying too much about what others may think. Being\n                able to connect certain events and seeing how they have prepared\n                you for things to come full circle is a peaceful feeling.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>I’m just gonna be myself and see where that takes me…</p>\n            </Description>\n          </Card>\n        </CardContainerr>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Transit;\n\nconst Card = styled.div`\n  width: 100%;\n\n  border: gold;\n  padding: 10px;\n  margin-right: 30%;\n  margin-left: 30%;\n  background-color: white;\n`;\n\nconst Description = styled.div`\n  padding: 2%;\n  color: black;\n`;\n\nconst CardContainerr = styled.div`\n  display: flex;\n`;\n","import styled from \"styled-components\";\n\nfunction Sportz() {\n  return (\n    <section id=\"skills\" style={{ backgroundColor: \"black\" }}>\n      <div>\n        <CardContainerr>\n          <Card>\n            <Description>\n              <center>\n                <h1> SportZ</h1>\n                <h4>June 15, 2018</h4>\n              </center>\n              <p>\n                Like most Americans sports have always been a large part of my\n                life and like some of these people I have done a few crazy\n                things for sports. Whether it be lathering up in a fresh coat of\n                body paint to sport your teams colors or waking up at 5am for\n                games and training growing up.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Moving to China after graduation to work and coach football is\n                something else that may have been considered crazy. Not only did\n                I decide on this because of the opportunity to travel but being\n                older and seeing how sports shaped my values, decision making\n                and helped open up my true personality. Now having a greater\n                appreciation for those moments that will forever be cherished, I\n                jumped at the chance to enable others to have similar\n                experiences.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Being a part of a growing sports culture in China allowed me to\n                revisit these experiences and see them through a new\n                perspective. Being on the front end of an emerging culture\n                allows access to things I wouldn’t have had back home given the\n                hierarchy of any established sports culture. Various travel and\n                collaboration opportunities with big brands like NHL, NFL,\n                Tencent, Nike, Adidas, Under Armour and others. Opportunities\n                and access to things that perhaps I was not qualified for at the\n                time.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Everybody needs a medium to get their message across, to an\n                audience whether that is sports, music, food or something else.\n                Most audiences need that candy to mask the medicine so the\n                message is easier to consume.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                The medium for a large portion of my time here was sports and\n                served as that “in” with a portion of the local Chinese\n                community. Living in a different culture emphasized not only the\n                differences but also similarities in human behavior. With the\n                low number of Americans spending time abroad and even lower\n                among minorities this allowed them to learn about me to either\n                disprove or confirm their perceptions about Americans and or\n                more specifically black men.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>We have to get to know each other better</p>\n\n              <p>It helps us understand each other better</p>\n\n              <p>Trust each other more and live more peacefully</p>\n\n              <p>\n                Getting away from the glamorous system of the NCAA and having\n                global experiences that let me discover what I enjoy outside of\n                sports is something that few former athletes and even fewer\n                black men get to experience. Whether it is for financial\n                reasons, cultural stigmas or just the general fears that keep\n                people from self-exploration.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Something I often remembering hearing during my times of sports\n                trainings is…\n              </p>\n\n              <p>“Become comfortable with being uncomfortable “</p>\n\n              <p>\n                Like those trainings this time abroad has helped me develop this\n                concept that will continue throughout life, as I may will never\n                reach that moment of complete comfort.

The American\n                Music Therapy Association (AMTA) reports that music therapy\n                programs can be designed to achieve goals such as managing\n                stress, enhancing memory, and alleviating pain.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Pharrell Williams is held in high regard internationally not\n                only for his music but his overall creativity. This is\n                attributed to his curiosity, Williams, who describes himself as\n                curious and ever the “perpetual student,” said he finds\n                inspiration from just about anywhere — whether that be Lagerfeld\n                or strangers on the street.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                The relationship between curiosity and creativity is shown\n                through the various genres Pharrell samples in his music.\n                Sampling sounds from gospel services to Midwestern funk bands\n                and most famously his many Japanese influences.

My one step that\n                sparked me into a unique career oriented around sports and East\n                Asia came from a family vacation during high school. Various\n                accidents led to learning languages and developing different\n                tastes in music. Learning more about history and seeing the\n                reemergence of cultural themes through music and traveling keeps\n                things from not seeming so different.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                The goal of improving daily life is the consistent cultural\n                theme, musical transit is the sample, the subway symphony\n                campaign started a few years ago in New York then later turned\n                into this…\n              </p>\n\n              <iframe\n                width=\"560\"\n                height=\"315\"\n                src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8q6p8VJRMJ8\"\n                title=\"YouTube video player\"\n                frameborder=\"0\"\n                allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n                allowfullscreen\n              ></iframe>\n\n              <p>\n                Let your goal or inspiration morph into what it may become for\n                it could benefit not only yourself but also perhaps those around\n                you.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Tokyo Metro decided on the trial after the classical music\n                played by accident on a train in July last year drew favorable\n                responses from many passengers.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                The ideal man bears the accidents of life with dignity and\n                grace, making the best of circumstances.\n              </p>\n\n              <iframe\n                width=\"560\"\n                height=\"315\"\n                src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wCsO56kWwTc\"\n                title=\"YouTube video player\"\n                frameborder=\"0\"\n                allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n                allowfullscreen\n              ></iframe>\n            </Description>\n          </Card>\n        </CardContainerr>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Music;\n\nconst Card = styled.div`\n  width: 100%;\n\n  border: gold;\n  padding: 10px;\n  margin-right: 30%;\n  margin-left: 30%;\n  background-color: white;\n`;\n\nconst Description = styled.div`\n  padding: 2%;\n  color: black;\n`;\n\nconst CardContainerr = styled.div`\n  display: flex;\n`;\n","import styled from \"styled-components\";\n\nfunction Experiences() {\n  return (\n    <section id=\"skills\" style={{ backgroundColor: \"blue\" }}>\n      <div>\n        <CardContainerr>\n          <Card>\n            <Description>\n              <center>\n                <h1> Distinguishing Cultural {\"&\"} Universal Experiences</h1>\n                <h4>July 13, 2015</h4>\n              </center>\n\n              <p>\n                Connecting with consumers on an emotional level is key,\n                campaigns with purely emotional content performed about twice as\n                well (31% vs. 16%) with only rational content, and those that\n                were purely emotional did a little better (31% vs 26%) those\n                that mixed emotional and rational content. Pringle and Field\n                attribute this split to our brain’s ability to process emotional\n                input without cognitive processing as well as our brain’s more\n                powerful recording of emotional stimuli.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Consumers are not merely buying a product to satisfy their need\n                but the use of a product also represents what the owner values\n                and it becomes an extension of the owner. Marketing plays a\n                vital function in the consumer goods industry as differentiation\n                on product function or specification appears futile to the\n                consumers through advertisement. Advertising in the category of\n                consumer goods industry increasingly relies on emotional appeal\n                seeking to connect with the norms and values of the customers.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Marketers are able to manipulate consumers to make irrational\n                decisions by playing on their emotions. Identifying specific\n                emotions to target can be found in the experiences that these\n                individuals have. Being someone that has an interest in\n                multicultural marketing I am developing an understanding of the\n                different experiences that come with the various cultures.\n                Although every individual experiences life in different ways\n                there are some universal experiences-with varying degrees.\n                Universal experiences are registered in the deepest levels of\n                each person, and as well, it also becomes an integral part of\n                the collective memory, or consciousness, of humanity. Yes,\n                Humanity HAS a collective consciousness, which consists of the\n                experiences of every human being that has ever lived on this\n                earth. The scheme of life is for an evolving expression of life.\n                As experience is gathered, so does the ability of the “group\n                soul” which is responsible for that life form. As the\n                experiences accumulate as a result of all those lives lived, so\n                does the ability for these forces to project more complex life\n                forms. So, the levels of intelligence responsible for the\n                projection of what was to become the most complex expression of\n                life on this planet gradually accumulated enough wisdom and\n                experience to project a more advanced form of primate. Then, as\n                the experience grew, more and more advanced expressions of life\n                forms became possible, until, eventually, the present form of\n                humanity was possible.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Why do you think the remarkable growth of technology and science\n                has been possible in such a short time?\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Well, every human being that has ever existed has played a part\n                in it all. Yes, every human being. As a result of pain and\n                suffering, joy and pleasure, the lessons and experiences have\n                been registered in the race memory of the overall group soul\n                responsible for humanity. Naturally this is also filtered back\n                to yet higher levels of intelligence, and eventually backs to\n                the Planetary Source, the Solar Source, then the level of\n                intelligence responsible for the Galaxy. And, eventually back to\n                the Universal Source. Who knows, there may be (and probably are)\n                even higher levels of intelligence, but that is a matter of\n                discussion at another time and another place.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                But let us not be distracted from the issue at hand. As a result\n                of the accumulated experiences of humanity for the relatively\n                short period of time it has existed (in universal terms), the\n                experience has accumulated to a sufficient level for the next\n                evolutionary step to take place. We live at a critical time of\n                change on our planet. The rate of vibration has to increase to\n                accommodate the more advanced energies of the coming new age.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                We have to learn how to accommodate these subtler, yet more\n                powerful energies. We have to appreciate the fact that as these\n                new energies are very powerful, they may not always benefit all\n                of the present form of humanity. Let our lives make a difference\n                for future generations, prepare ourselves, now, for a new level\n                of self awareness and enlightenment. Reach out for a level of\n                understanding, which will change our understanding, and\n                enjoyment of life. The importance for marketers to understand\n                and identify these experiences will be critical as the\n                multicultural population increases.\n              </p>\n            </Description>\n          </Card>\n        </CardContainerr>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Experiences;\n\nconst Card = styled.div`\n  width: 100%;\n\n  border: gold;\n  padding: 10px;\n  margin-right: 30%;\n  margin-left: 30%;\n  background-color: white;\n`;\n\nconst Description = styled.div`\n  padding: 2%;\n  color: black;\n`;\n\nconst CardContainerr = styled.div`\n  display: flex;\n`;\n","import styled from \"styled-components\";\n\nfunction Reality() {\n  return (\n    <section id=\"skills\" style={{ backgroundColor: \"black\" }}>\n      <div>\n        <CardContainerr>\n          <Card>\n            <Description>\n              <center>\n                <h1>Merging Sci-Fi {\"&\"} Reality</h1>\n                <h4>July 13, 2015</h4>\n              </center>\n              <p>\n                The exponential growth of the world in the last 5 to 10 years is\n                outstanding when compared to the 5 to 10 years prior.\n              </p>\n              <iframe\n                width=\"560\"\n                height=\"315\"\n                src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/cL9Wu2kWwSY\"\n                title=\"YouTube video player\"\n                frameborder=\"0\"\n                allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n                allowfullscreen\n              ></iframe>\n\n              <p>\n                Things that seemed so unrealistic just 10 years ago are slowly\n                becoming reality, most recently with the incident at a\n                Volkswagen factory. An automotive assembly line robot killed a\n                worker at a car factory in Germany this week, a prosecutor’s\n                office said. The man, 21, was installing the robot at a\n                Volkswagen assembly line on Tuesday in Baunatal, which lies next\n                to the city of Kassel, local newspaper the Hessische\n                Niedersaechsische Allgemeine reported, citing a VW spokesman.\n                The robot gripped and pressed him up against a metal plate,\n                crushing his chest. Despite efforts to revive him, the worker,\n                an employee of a third-party vendor, died at a hospital, the\n                paper reported. After hearing about this I couldn’t help but\n                think of the movie I, Robot with Will Smith.\n              </p>\n\n              <iframe\n                width=\"560\"\n                height=\"315\"\n                src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/05bGPiyM4jg\"\n                title=\"YouTube video player\"\n                frameborder=\"0\"\n                allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n                allowfullscreen\n              ></iframe>\n\n              <p>\n                The first time I watched this when it came out it seemed like\n                such a far fetched idea, and that was only 2004 but now this has\n                become a reality (much smaller scale and less star power than\n                the movie though). Deaths caused by industrial robots seem to be\n                more of a reality than you might imagine – in the United States,\n                at least one person is killed every year in a similar incident.\n                And they have ceased causing people to break into a cold sweat\n                over it, desensitized as we have become to such things. Early on\n                in the continuing lifespan of science fiction, robots were a\n                novelty. We have come to take them for granted now, in spite of\n                the fact that the autonomous, self-conscious entities promised\n                to us by the genre still seem a long way off. But that’s hardly\n                the point, it seems.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                The science fiction trope – be it time travel, artificial\n                intelligence, or robots – serves a twin purpose of being both\n                literal truth and metaphor. Therein lies its unique strength.\n                And this “literalness” seems to have bled into “real life” and\n                altered our perceptions of technology. Technology alternately\n                sparks a sense of wonder and then reverts to banality, thanks\n                largely to a limited attention span, and, indeed, too many\n                distractions plaguing the twenty-first century. And science\n                fiction, that genre dedicated to invoking a “sense of wonder”,\n                has ironically inured us to such things. If we are to look at\n                the incident itself, tragic as it is, it’s a little hard to see\n                why it might have caused such a stir. The death was apparently\n                caused by human error, and the “robot” in question seems to have\n                been a mechanized automaton whose job it had been to pick up car\n                parts all by itself. But the image evoked by such an incident\n                transcends any such attempt at rendering it less awe-inspiring.\n                This is because of the sheer vocabulary of images science\n                fiction has helped build over time, when it comes to robots and\n                artificial intelligence.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                As global economies become increasingly more competitive and\n                seeing some nations putting its people at risks to get ahead I\n                can’t help but wonder what other issues may occur because the\n                desire for speed over quality.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>The future is closer than you think</p>\n              <iframe\n                src=\"https://giphy.com/embed/20Mr9uJLkWfqWDs6Ul\"\n                width=\"480\"\n                height=\"324\"\n                frameBorder=\"0\"\n                class=\"giphy-embed\"\n                allowFullScreen\n              ></iframe>\n            </Description>\n          </Card>\n        </CardContainerr>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Reality;\n\nconst Card = styled.div`\n  width: 100%;\n\n  border: gold;\n  padding: 10px;\n  margin-right: 30%;\n  margin-left: 30%;\n  background-color: white;\n`;\n\nconst Description = styled.div`\n  padding: 2%;\n  color: black;\n`;\n\nconst CardContainerr = styled.div`\n  display: flex;\n`;\n","import styled from \"styled-components\";\n\nfunction Cross() {\n  return (\n    <section id=\"skills\" style={{ backgroundColor: \"black\" }}>\n      <div>\n        <CardContainerr>\n          <Card>\n            <Description>\n              <center>\n                <h1>Look Before You Cross</h1>\n                <h4>June 29, 2015</h4>\n              </center>\n              <iframe\n                width=\"560\"\n                height=\"315\"\n                src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/sglZGSwK6ow\"\n                title=\"YouTube video player\"\n                frameborder=\"0\"\n                allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n                allowfullscreen\n              ></iframe>\n\n              <p>\n                As new media emerges keeping track and being able to develop a\n                full understanding of what you’re using while staying current\n                becomes increasingly difficult which can lead to people putting\n                themselves at risk which leaves ethical questions to be\n                answered. However positive aspects include greater\n                interconnectedness, easier communication, and the exposure of\n                information that in the past could have more easily been\n                suppressed by totalitarian regimes. While there have been huge\n                benefits to society from the digital revolution, especially in\n                terms of the accessibility of information, there are a number of\n                concerns. Expanded powers of communication and information\n                sharing, increased capabilities for existing technologies, and\n                the advent of new technology brought with it many potential\n                opportunities for exploitation. The digital revolution helped\n                usher in a new age of mass surveillance, generating a range of\n                new civil and human rights issues. Reliability of data became an\n                issue as information could easily be replicated, but not easily\n                verified. The digital revolution made it possible to store and\n                track facts, articles, statistics, as well as minutiae hitherto\n                unfeasible.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                The digital media system is dismantling the already weakened\n                barriers that have traditionally separated content and\n                marketing. By seamlessly weaving together content, advertising,\n                marketing, and direct transactions, online media can provide\n                unprecedented access to individual consumer data along with a\n                variety of direct-response and brand-marketing opportunities.\n                This hunger to reach these segmented groups is what often leads\n                to privacy concerns. The value of the web is likely driven by\n                the fact that they are mostly ad-funded and free to users, but\n                users face the risk of revealing too much information, which\n                could be used without consent, for targeted advertising or for\n                any other use. The scope here is privacy issues linked to the\n                unpermitted use of personal data and web-surfing behavior\n                information, including targeted advertising. By concentrating on\n                all applications aside from e-commerce, we will be able to\n                contrast how people make trade-offs on the web for the majority\n                of their online time usage.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                While a large number of web users are indeed greatly concerned\n                by cyber-privacy issues, the value users are willing to pay to\n                ensure their privacy protection – an order of magnitude below\n                the value users extract from using currently mostly ad-based,\n                free online applications such as Facebook and Google. The value\n                for privacy is not homogenous in the online user population,\n                seven segments with different trade-offs between the value of\n                cyber-privacy protection and use of online applications. There\n                is no doubt that concern for privacy has become an important\n                matter on the Internet, which has been increased because of the\n                situation with Edward Snowden and NSA. Specifically the\n                increased interest in privacy on two of the most popular\n                websites, a Google web search regarding online privacy generated\n                no less than 700 million entries on July 17, 2011. Assessing the\n                evolution of web search queries on Google Insights on the same\n                date shows that the terms ‘Google privacy’ and ‘Facebook\n                privacy’ have quickly increased in importance. Despite the\n                growing interest in privacy, consumer actions leave\n                organizations in a grey area in which to make business\n                decisions. Today, online users still rarely use the opt-out\n                service that prevents third parties from using their data.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                In a fast paced world how sure are you that you are able to\n                navigate your way through?\n              </p>\n            </Description>\n          </Card>\n        </CardContainerr>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Cross;\n\nconst Card = styled.div`\n  width: 100%;\n\n  border: gold;\n  padding: 10px;\n  margin-right: 30%;\n  margin-left: 30%;\n  background-color: white;\n`;\n\nconst Description = styled.div`\n  padding: 2%;\n  color: black;\n`;\n\nconst CardContainerr = styled.div`\n  display: flex;\n`;\n","import styled from \"styled-components\";\n\nfunction Simplicity() {\n  return (\n    <section id=\"skills\" style={{ backgroundColor: \"black\" }}>\n      <div>\n        <CardContainerr>\n          <Card>\n            <Description>\n              <center>\n                <h1>Revolution of Simplicity</h1>\n                <h4>June 23, 2015</h4>\n              </center>\n              <p>\n                The Digital Revolution, known as the Third Industrial\n                Revolution, is the change from analog, mechanical, and\n                electronic technology to digital technology which began anywhere\n                from the late 1950s to the late 1970s with the adoption and\n                proliferation of digital computers and digital record keeping\n                that continues to the present day. The growth of digital\n                technology is giving power to individuals to communicate their\n                experiences, which has allowed individuals to come together and\n                develop solutions to universal issues.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                The Revolutions of 2011 were enabled by social networking and\n                smartphone technology; however these revolutions in hindsight\n                largely failed to reach their goals as hardcore Islamist\n                governments and in Syria a civil war have formed in the absence\n                of the dictatorships that were toppled. The economic impact of\n                the digital revolution has been large. Without the World Wide\n                Web for example, globalization and outsourcing would not be\n                nearly as feasible as they are today. The digital revolution\n                radically changed the way individuals and companies interact.\n                Small regional companies were suddenly given access to much\n                larger markets. Concepts such as On-demand services and\n                manufacturing and rapidly dropping technology costs made\n                possible innovations in all aspects of industry and everyday\n                life. We are living in a revolution and the ability to\n                communicate universal experiences is slowly affecting the\n                physical world similar to the revolutions prior. The\n                Agricultural Revolution led to agricultural cities in the\n                ancient world in the Middle East, Mesoamerica, China, the Indus\n                Valley, Southern Europe and South America. Then the Industrial\n                Revolution led to industrial cities in the 19th century such as\n                Manchester, Newcastle Upon Tyne and New York City. In the 20th\n                century the rise of the service economy caused people to leave\n                the industrial cities and move out into the suburbs. The\n                Industrial Revolution and Digital Revolution are now taking\n                place concurrently in China and India as people leave the rural\n                areas for industrial and high tech cities like Beijing, Shanghai\n                and Mumbai. The way these revolutions shaped cities is clear and\n                has set a precedent and continues as we see the way our physical\n                locations are changing because of the current revolution.\n              </p>\n\n              <iframe\n                width=\"560\"\n                height=\"315\"\n                src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/MnGAAILD4nU\"\n                title=\"YouTube video player\"\n                frameborder=\"0\"\n                allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n                allowfullscreen\n              ></iframe>\n\n              <p>\n                As things become increasingly simple the opportunity for\n                marketers becomes more difficult because businesses are less\n                willing to sacrifice their small-scaled product or service.\n              </p>\n            </Description>\n          </Card>\n        </CardContainerr>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Simplicity;\n\nconst Card = styled.div`\n  width: 100%;\n\n  border: gold;\n  padding: 10px;\n  margin-right: 30%;\n  margin-left: 30%;\n  background-color: white;\n`;\n\nconst Description = styled.div`\n  padding: 2%;\n  color: black;\n`;\n\nconst CardContainerr = styled.div`\n  display: flex;\n`;\n","import styled from \"styled-components\";\n\nfunction Chase() {\n  return (\n    <section id=\"skills\" style={{ backgroundColor: \"black\" }}>\n      <div>\n        <CardContainerr>\n          <Card>\n            <Description>\n              <center>\n                <h1> The Chase</h1>\n                <h4>June 17, 2015</h4>\n              </center>\n              <iframe\n                width=\"560\"\n                height=\"315\"\n                src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/iMEl9VfgkMs\"\n                title=\"YouTube video player\"\n                frameborder=\"0\"\n                allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n                allowfullscreen\n              ></iframe>\n\n              <p>\n                I think this video does an excellent job in showing the chase of\n                the mouse (consumers) by the cat (marketers). For those that\n                have followed the cartoon the cat never catches the mouse, which\n                fits the never ending chase of consumers of various platforms\n                i.e. myspace to facebook to twitter to instagram to snapchat to…\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                As marketers we destroy media platforms for consumers by\n                flooding the market with ads and consumers flee to new networks\n                and technology. Similar to the way in when your parents use\n                something it no longer becomes cool you are forced to turn to\n                something new. Is it because they need the next cool thing,\n                oversaturated with unwanted info or simply growing bored. As the\n                rate of technology is growing exponentially the turnover rate\n                will grow leaving marketers increasingly one step behind unless\n                things change. This is already becoming prevalent with Twitter.\n                As brands are finally catching on to this platform and the usage\n                is in decline, specifically among younger consumers.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Research for the declining popularity of Facebook among younger\n                consumers is finally being published, which shows the gap in\n                marketers and younger consumers. Indeed, even Facebook itself\n                admitted last fall that it had lost younger users. “We did see a\n                decrease in [teenage] daily users [during the quarter],\n                especially younger teens,” Facebook chief financial officer\n                David Ebersman said during a call with analysts. With more than\n                half of teens stating social media plays a role in purchases,\n                Twitter has surpassed Facebook as the site deemed most\n                important, according to a fall survey by investment-banking firm\n                Piper Jaffray. The report also found Facebook’s popularity is\n                diminishing among this key demographic, with 23 percent of\n                teenagers stating it is the most important social network site,\n                down from 33 percent six months ago and 42 percent a year ago.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                In the past Facebook has denied this trend is occurring, but in\n                its third-quarter earnings call this month, the company finally\n                acknowledged the fact the social network site is waning among\n                youths. In addition to the obvious problem of having to accept\n                friend requests from grandma and long lost relatives, privacy is\n                a big concern. Facebook just cut a privacy setting that kept all\n                user names out of the social network’s graph search. It also\n                specifically targeted the teen demographic when it decided to\n                allow 13- to 17-year-olds the ability to share photo, updates\n                and comments with the public, not just friends. The result?\n                Advertisers now have access to private user information they\n                didn’t have before, a move that may not bode well with teens.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                With a marketing philosophy like the quote below it is clear how\n                consumers can become annoyed with advertisement…\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                “The more content I can put out, the more luck I have,” he says.\n                He’s redeployed an employee at VaynerMedia, his social media\n                consultancy, to “shadow my life” by following him to record his\n                remarks and turn them into social media content.” – Gary\n                Vaynerchuk\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Instead of relentlessly demanding more consumer attention and\n                creating unwanted content, treat the attention that is gained\n                with value and provide useful content for people. Then ask\n                yourself a simple question of any new marketing efforts: is this\n                campaign/email/microsite/print ad/etc. going to reduce the\n                cognitive overload for consumers feel as they shop my category?\n                If the answer is “no” or “not sure,” go back to the drawing\n                board. When it comes to interacting with your customers, more\n                isn’t better. By putting the audience first, we create content\n                they will read, share, and talk about rather than expediting the\n                process of consumers heading to a new platform.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>Will the cat ever catch the mouse?</p>\n            </Description>\n          </Card>\n        </CardContainerr>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Chase;\n\nconst Card = styled.div`\n  width: 100%;\n\n  border: gold;\n  padding: 10px;\n  margin-right: 30%;\n  margin-left: 30%;\n  background-color: white;\n`;\n\nconst Description = styled.div`\n  padding: 2%;\n  color: black;\n`;\n\nconst CardContainerr = styled.div`\n  display: flex;\n`;\n","import styled from \"styled-components\";\n\nfunction Regulate() {\n  return (\n    <section id=\"skills\" style={{ backgroundColor: \"black\" }}>\n      <div>\n        <CardContainerr>\n          <Card>\n            <Description>\n              <center>\n                <h1> Innovation or Regulation</h1>\n                <h4>June 8, 2015</h4>\n              </center>\n              <p>\n                Marketing is a creativity-meets-systems discipline with many\n                moving parts. Unlike journalism, every blog post, info graphic,\n                guide, and social media strategy has an underlying sales and\n                revenue objective. As marketers our ultimate goal is to steadily\n                move audiences to the point of transaction. In our hearts, we\n                want to position our brands as storytellers and strong creative\n                forces. Often times though we are stifled with sacred cows,\n                “creative” guidelines, workplace environment or even legal\n                restrictions. For truly “creative” ideas the inability to use\n                previous situations as a precedent and establish regulations is\n                often what hinders innovation. Another aspect to this is what\n                people grow up becoming used to affects their view on the\n                credibility of certain strategies, leaving new ideas to be\n                pushed by the wayside. Multiple occurrences of these situations\n                foster a work environment that stifles innovation. We tend to\n                think of creativity as original ideas but it is rather\n                individuals thinking of situations in a different light or\n                finding ways to express ideas in subtle, original, or\n                less-than-obvious ways. Creativity might not be a new product or\n                service but rather a new use for it, Harvard Business professor\n                Teresa Amabile points out that in business creativity takes on a\n                different form. The goal is simple—across teams, we want to\n                bring new ideas to market in ways that support the needs of our\n                customer bases. “To be creative, an idea must also be\n                appropriate—useful and actionable,” write Amabile. “It must\n                somehow influence the way business gets done—by improving a\n                product, for instance, or by opening up a new way to approach a\n                process.”.\n              </p>\n              <p>Fostering a creative work environment includes…</p>\n              <li>\n                Challenge – Ensure that individuals are matched with projects\n                that align with their skills and passions\n              </li>\n              <br></br>\n              <li>\n                Freedom – Give people autonomy to set their own direction\n                regarding ‘how’ to complete their work\n              </li>\n              <br></br>\n              <li>\n                Resources – Provide team members with the time and money that\n                they need to see projects through\n              </li>\n              <br></br>\n              <li>\n                Team design – Pay careful attention to the creative teams that\n                you’re building, with a clear division of roles and effort\n              </li>\n              <br></br>\n              <li>\n                Encouragement – Reward successes through positive reinforcement\n              </li>\n              <br></br>\n              <li>\n                Support – Ensure that systems and processes are in place to make\n                creative work a top priority\n              </li>\n              <p>\n                As new media emerges the way marketers use these mediums require\n                a faith in the judgment of certain individuals because the lack\n                of regulation of the unknown. Rather than creating rules for the\n                sake of rules marketing teams should focus on providing\n                carefully selected team members with resources that foster\n                creative use of new media. Individuals that are able to simplify\n                complex situations will be ideal candidates, being able to find\n                simplicity in a world that continues to be more complex and\n                taking characteristics from multiple sources to develop a new\n                product, service or ad. Inspiration is something that cannot be\n                limited to a single or couple fields or people because anything\n                can be an inspiration.\n              </p>\n              <iframe\n                width=\"560\"\n                height=\"315\"\n                src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6oY25nOld2U\"\n                title=\"YouTube video player\"\n                frameborder=\"0\"\n                allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n                allowfullscreen\n              ></iframe>\n\n              <p>\n                Personally one of the best things for me is traveling, going to\n                a different part of the world forces me to think in different\n                ways, the food order, the way I get around and also the people I\n                talk to.

Children who have scored\n                highly on the Torrence test in years past have become\n                innovators, authors, entrepreneurs, software developers,\n                diplomats, and college presidents. In May, however, a researcher\n                at William and Mary analyzed over 300,000 Torrence scores and\n                observed that creativity has been steadily on the rise. That is,\n                until 1990. Over the last 20 years, CQ scores have tumbled.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                While innovation is essential for success in marketing this is\n                something that can also cause issues internally with brands\n                because of the fear for the unknown and a need for flexible\n                rules.This need for flexibility starts with the ability to\n                effectively handle feedback because brands reflect the creative\n                visions of many different stakeholders including marketers,\n                engineers, c-level executives, in-the-trenches specialists, and\n                even customers. That’s why the feedback process is so important\n                to the marketing process—particularly around content, social\n                media, visuals, and campaign copy.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                In general people follow rules because nobody wants to be an\n                exception and it is rude if the rules are not followed. The\n                challenge is to know what to improve and change and what to\n                keep, thus the battle of continuing with regulated methods or\n                branch out and focus on innovation begins. Innovation and\n                regulation simply don’t work together, regulated\n                industries—including strictly licensed services from lawyers and\n                doctors, public utilities such as power and water companies, and\n                government-provided services including roads, bridges, and the\n                post office—operate outside market-based systems. Competition is\n                prohibited, even criminalized. Since innovative technologies are\n                a particularly ruthless kind of competitor, they are directly or\n                indirectly banned.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                As new media emerges establishing and maintaining regulation\n                while encouraging innovation will be the ultimate challenge.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Don’t let the fear of the unknown hold back your marketing team.\n              </p>\n            </Description>\n          </Card>\n        </CardContainerr>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Regulate;\n\nconst Card = styled.div`\n  width: 100%;\n\n  border: gold;\n  padding: 10px;\n  margin-right: 30%;\n  margin-left: 30%;\n  background-color: white;\n`;\n\nconst Description = styled.div`\n  padding: 2%;\n  color: black;\n`;\n\nconst CardContainerr = styled.div`\n  display: flex;\n`;\n","import styled from \"styled-components\";\n\nfunction Psychologist() {\n  return (\n    <section id=\"skills\" style={{ backgroundColor: \"black\" }}>\n      <div>\n        <CardContainerr>\n          <Card>\n            <Description>\n              <center>\n                <h1>Rise of the Cyber Psychologist</h1>\n                <h4>June 2, 2015</h4>\n              </center>\n              <p>\n                Life in the 21st Century increasingly involves ‘multi-tasking’\n                while making use of our digital tools, social and professional\n                networks, mobile technology, wi-fi, and an “app” or product for\n                almost everything one might crave, on-demand. Our screens have\n                shrunken and our concepts of ‘identity’, ‘friend’, ‘like’ and\n                ‘connected’ re-defined. Our lives, on either side of the Digital\n                Native Divide, have become shaped and influenced by the ease and\n                constancy of data sharing, by social marketing, by technology\n                tools, and by shared expectations and social norms, increasingly\n                centering around our devotion to devices. Lives are shaped by\n                experiences and technology is increasingly becoming a larger\n                part of these experiences. The advancement in media and\n                technology will continue to shape experiences but the core human\n                concepts will remain constant making the psychology of consumers\n                important.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                A surprising percentage of children have had an imaginary friend\n                at some point, according to Marjorie Taylor and her colleagues\n                at the University of Oregon, by age seven, about 37% of children\n                take imaginative play a step farther and create an invisible\n                friend. The variety of forms that invisible friends come in is a\n                testament to the power of imagination. This “imagination” is\n                something that can soon be limited thanks to a developing\n                product called Musio. Natural language and machine learning\n                company AKA says it’s taking the next step toward the creation\n                of a robot that you can really, truly talk to, with a new\n                project called Musio.\n              </p>\n              <iframe\n                width=\"560\"\n                height=\"315\"\n                src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/K63au9RV9S4\"\n                title=\"YouTube video player\"\n                frameborder=\"0\"\n                allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\"\n                allowfullscreen\n              ></iframe>\n              <p>\n                Perhaps this invention and the usage of social media among\n                consumers is an attempt to combat the feeling of loneliness.\n                Though technology has changed the tools we have to reach out to\n                others, it has not changed our deep psychological need to truly\n                connect with others. Social media can help us satisfy a portion\n                of this need. We let others know what we are doing and hear\n                about their activities. However, this doesn’t fulfill our\n                deepest and most basic need to establish an emotional connection\n                with another person. At its most fundamental level, this\n                connection is not about reading or sending updates of\n                activities. Sometimes words do not even need to be exchanged.\n                Spending a lazy Saturday afternoon in comfortable silence with a\n                close friend can mean more to us than a mass of comments on our\n                Instagram. At times social media can create a dangerous illusion\n                of being connected. We pay attention to numbers on Facebook and\n                Twitter, and often fool ourselves into thinking that we’ve\n                satisfied that need to form relationships with others This\n                desire to connect with people is shown in the large percentage\n                of time consumers spend on social media especially when compared\n                to other options on the internet. Social media swallows more\n                than a quarter of time spent online and a third of all internet\n                usage is now happening via mobile, a new global report has\n                found. The average person has five social media accounts and\n                spends around 1 hour and 40 minutes browsing these networks\n                every day, accounting for 28pc of the total time spent on the\n                internet.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                In a time with such a variety of choice the job as a marketer\n                becomes increasingly difficult, choice is the purest expression\n                of free will. The freedom to choose allows us to shape our lives\n                exactly how we wish, provided we have the resources to do so.\n                For marketers to understand why consumers choose\n                products/services they need to understand the mind of consumers\n                as a whole to take it to the next level. Being able to bring\n                human concepts to their core will keep marketers from being\n                overwhelmed in the growing media. Choice theory is the study of\n                how decisions get made. The term was coined in a book of the\n                same name by William Glasser, who argued that all choices are\n                made to satisfy five basic needs: survival, love and belonging,\n                power, freedom, and fun.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Social media and technology is something that temporary reduces\n                the feeling of being alone and nobody wants to be alone\n                regardless of how they show it because it satisfies basic needs\n              </p>\n            </Description>\n          </Card>\n        </CardContainerr>\n      </div>\n    </section>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default Psychologist;\n\nconst Card = styled.div`\n  width: 100%;\n\n  border: gold;\n  padding: 10px;\n  margin-right: 30%;\n  margin-left: 30%;\n  background-color: white;\n`;\n\nconst Description = styled.div`\n  padding: 2%;\n  color: black;\n`;\n\nconst CardContainerr = styled.div`\n  display: flex;\n`;\n","import styled from \"styled-components\";\n\nfunction Template() {\n  return (\n    <section id=\"skills\" style={{ backgroundColor: \"black\" }}>\n      <div>\n        <CardContainerr>\n          <Card>\n            <Description>\n              <center>\n                <h1> Lost in the Sauce</h1>\n                <h4>May 23, 2015</h4>\n              </center>\n              <p>\n                “If a man does not have sauce (technology) he is lost, but the\n                same man can be lost in the sauce (technology)” – Gucci Mane\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                As the immersion in “new” media becomes more intense so does the\n                power of marketers, as this trend continues consumers can become\n                overwhelmed steering them towards “new-er” media. With the\n                growing trend of wearables and the recent release of the iWatch\n                consumers become increasingly connected to technology.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Wearable technology is the same as other once “new” media, once\n                consumers are there then these platforms can be used by\n                marketers which explains the never ending cat and mouse game\n                between marketers and consumers in the various platform options.\n                The increase of omnichannel consumers is forcing marketers to\n                look for additional platforms to introduce and maintain a\n                relationship with consumers. Currently “36% of U.S.\n                organizations interact with customers and prospects in five or\n                more channels”. Wearables appear to be one of the next\n                platforms, Disney Magic Bands just announced a $1 billion\n                expansion of MyMagic+ including how they can leverage other\n                wearable technology. The ability to reach the majority of\n                consumers 24/7 is now realistic because of the easy access to\n                world through smartphones and wearables. Sometimes people spend\n                a little more time then they should on their phones, which has\n                led to changes in society…\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Fortunately for marketers this increases the margin of error\n                given the extended time consumers spend on phones. Globalization\n                has increased because of “new” media, transformations in\n                international communication have created the perception for many\n                of increased interconnectedness, of a shrinking of the world.\n                New media technologies and the Internet have intensified this\n                interconnectedness between countries and the rapid spread of\n                information, news, content and programming.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                Interactive media content has potential to be the next “new”\n                given the shared characteristic that has made social media\n                popular. As consumers search for additional ways to be immersed\n                in brands, products and services the potential is there.\n                Everyone wants to be immersed in interesting web content, and\n                brands are quickly learning how to use that to their advantage.\n                But to succeed, it has to be done well. Interactive content is\n                continuing to grow through social media but could see\n                exponential growth with the development of virtual reality.\n                Virtual reality like many other things of today seemed\n                unrealistic 10 or 15 yrs ago but has now become realistic.\n                Virtual reality has always been an interesting concept, put on\n                goggles and be transported anywhere, it’s the same escapism\n                peddled by drugs, alcohol, sex, and art. Virtual reality at its\n                core is an organic experience. Depending on how wearables and\n                virtual reality progress will heat up the debate between “on”\n                and “off” screen marketing, should be an interesting thing to\n                monitor.\n              </p>\n\n              <p>\n                As “new” media becomes more immersive, do not get lost in the\n                sauce (technology).\n              </p>\n
