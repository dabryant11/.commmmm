                My time traveling has always brought me a new perspective and
                this past year was no different I saw more than I&rsquo;ve ever
                seen and possibly had the largest amount of personal growth in a
                years time. I met wonderful new people and ate delicious food
                while continuing to shape my global perspective. As I approached
                CMH airport I began my journey without a complete itinerary I
                couldn&rsquo;t help but be excited for the things to come and
                the opportunity to bridge the cultural gap between Chinese
                people and Americans. Six months ago I decided to move to the
                other side of the world while being unsure as to where I would
                live after my initial month in Shanghai. I now live in Zhuhai in
                China&rsquo;s southern Guangdong province, along the way I made
                a few stops to get the most out of the move.

                I was able to take away something from every destination whether
                big or small but something that always stuck with me regardless
                of the place was what I would experience at the airport in these
                locations. The desire that people in the airport have to make a
                connection with those around them is something that I have only
                seen inside airports and briefly at my time in hostels. Perhaps
                this attitude stems from the desire to remain within in their
                comfort level while physically being detached from their life at
                home. Moving to the other side of the world with all my personal
                belongings made me reevaluate this concept of home&#8230;
              </p>

                Seeing how an environment shapes an individuals thought process
                and actions by being in diverse company but also being in
                situations you may have never been in breeds an evolution in
                ones thought process. The hypocrisy that I am beginning to see
                in the world as each journey leads to a fuller view of the world
                is part funny and part sad given the common conflicts and
                misunderstandings that take place. At a time in the U.S. when
                Muslims are not welcomed by some I had the opportunity to learn
                more about their religion while in Malaysia, visit mosques and
                hear about some of the mistreatment my friends received during
                their time in the States. I could not help but think that they
                and their friends had many more stories to share explaining
                moments of discomfort whether on purpose or incidentally simply
                from a lack of understanding. There are a lot of pictures that
                can be painted by the media and or your friends &ndash;
                it&rsquo;s a big world and many angles to view it &ndash; so go
                experience it for yourself and develop your own perspective.

                A large part of my solo traveling is making new friends, which
                is not ideal for an introverted person like myself but becomes
                easier with the redundancy of typical conversations.
                &ldquo;Where are you from?&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;How long are
                you here?&rdquo; &ldquo;What are you doing here?&rdquo;
                &ldquo;Do you like it?&rdquo; &ndash; &ldquo;Are you going to
                stay?&rdquo; etc. The ability to truly enjoy the moment with
                most of these people constantly coming in and out of my life
                I&rsquo;ve learned to value the good that comes my way and enjoy
                something for what it is. I consider myself a very private
                person and for every person that invades my personal space in
                the overcrowded public transit there is a moment of joy I have
                for the person studying English uses me as a real life situation
                to chant out &ldquo;helloooo&rdquo;. For every person I meet
                that has something negative to say about another person,
                country, food etc. there is someone that has something positive
                to say. These types of situations are something that can only be
                experienced by exposing yourself to a large diverse group of
                people. This is why I try to encourage people to travel whenever
                they can &ndash; not only for the fancy picture they can put on
                their Instagram or not even solely for the food&#8230;but for
                the people you meet and the new perspective you develop by being
                open to new experiences. Living in China there are many things
                that could frustrate you but like most things, your attitude
                towards the situation alters your experience.

                Being a recent graduate and entering the workforce something
                that has been on my mind often during traveling is my perception
                of work and the lifestyle I wish to have as I grow older. After
                seeing various lifestyles from the people I went to school with
                on track with the typical successful career to the people in
                small villages that seemingly have nothing. Travel has forced me
                to question and formulate my own definition of success &ndash; I
                want the ability to do what I want (doesn&rsquo;t everybody?).
                Graduating from university and hearing about many of my peers
                being uneasy about their future especially when comparing their
                life to often portrayed glamorous lives of their peers on social
                media.

                The constant reevaluation of what I already know is just one of
                the many things I enjoy about travel. The crazy things keep you
                on your toes and teach you not to take things so serious while
                finding the joy in the bad.
