                This experience in China has been different in comparison to my
                previous travels, my journey here has been longer and more
                immersive. Crossing the half way point of my fellowship I have
                seen changes in the local environment. I&rsquo;m not referring
                to the countless shops that often switch owners or disappear
                completely nor am I talking about the numerous
                &ldquo;green&rdquo; skyscrapers that quickly turn to housing
                complexes but rather the people.

              <p>
                My first visit to China was May 2013 and comparing the
                landscape, culture and behavior to now is perhaps something that
                can only occur in a country with such a large population and
                swift action by the government set up. The large population has
                taught me not to confuse a few situations with a generalization,
                which I believe is how most stereotypes start.
              </p>

              <p>
                During my time in Zhuhai I have observed a change in peoples
                behaviors towards me compared to my initial arrival in August.
                One being the amount of people that stare at me throughout the
                day, in the early stages of my time here I would see locals
                doing 180 degree turns to stare which has now become a lowered
                degree or not at all as my time increases. Perhaps they confused
                me with the 4 other black people I have seen in Zhuhai or maybe
                it&rsquo;s their general curiosity talked about in countless
                blogs. Whatever the reason may be things are changing&#8230;or
                maybe I am just getting more use to it. An example of this
                development is comparing the first time I went to play
                basketball, I could feel the high expectations being a
                6&rsquo;4&rdquo; black man and all the expectations that come
                with that especially in a country where I have been asked a fair
                amount of silly race related questions. Maybe on some level it
                was karma for all the Americans that have asked Asian-Americans
                similar silly race related questions simply by not having a core
                base of understanding of other cultures.
              </p>

              <p> </p>

              <p>
                However after a few games and seeing my low shooting percentage
                I can&rsquo;t help but feel like I broke some stereotypes
                (that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m here for right?). Most of the
                people I have come across who ask these types of questions they
                are rarely asked with negative intentions, simply stemming from
                ignorance. Now living in a country that is not as racially
                diverse as the United States I see how this limited exposure to
                other cultures leads to the media playing the role of PR for
                various groups of people. For other foreigners living in or
                visiting China and wondering what the locals do with all the
                photos they take of us I think I may have found an
                answer&#8230;well at least a partial answer &ndash; WeChat.

                Surrounding yourself with diverse people forces you to learn
                more and be open minded, truly seeing people for a person and
                not a race, gender, class etc. You begin to see that most people
                deal with the same core issues but perhaps through a different
                perspective given the perception that others have about someone
                based on their race, gender, class etc. Traveling has reinforced
                my perception that things may not be as different as you
                initially think. A prime example of this is when I was having a
                conversation with another American living overseas and how his
                family and friends think his life is soooo much different living
                abroad. His response, &ldquo;I do the same things here that I
                would if I was in the States, I work, relax at home and spend
                time with friends I am just a little farther from home. Things
                are different yet the same, obviously there are differences in
                language and food options but at the core things remain the
                same.&rdquo; During my time here I have spent time at work,
                bars, festivals and sporting events, all things I probably would
                have done if I stayed in the States &ndash; seeing children pee
                on the side of the road and eating balut egg or chicken feet may
                have not happened.

              <p>
                A larger scale example of the similarities between the two
                countries is the reference to &ldquo;The American Dream&rdquo;
                or &ldquo;The Chinese Dream&rdquo;. Growing up in the States I
                often heard about the American Dream, while people reconsider
                what this means today I have often heard about the Chinese dream
                living here. I believe this concept of the dream is changing
                here as well because the younger generation has more examples of
                others that were able to make successful careers out of
                following their passions compared to those of earlier
                generations.

              <p>
                Below is a conversation between a friend and I that was sparked
                from some topics in my previous blog&#8230;
              </p>

              <p></p>

              <p>
                [I have started to notice more people whether be my age or older
                that have kind of given up on their search and I am very
                determined to make sure that I do not become one of those
                people. ]
              </p>

              <p>
                Me too. I think what you see, represents a further break-down of
                traditional employment. It is one of the great social and
                economic shifts of our time which affects everyone, not a
                generational thing.
              </p>

              <p>
                During my entire career, I depended on others (recruiters,
                interviewers, hiring managers) to offer me a job. Now that I
                have been a contractor for 5 years, I have still depended on
                recruiters to match me to jobs. The business (Free Agent Source)
                has grown slowly because neither of us founders are natural
                sales professionals. Both of us are capable, just didn&rsquo;t
                formally take on a sales role.
              </p>

              <p>
                Last year, I finally got angry about my situation. Jobs, gigs,
                recruiters&#8230; there are gate keepers every step of the way
                who put themselves in a position of judgment which makes job
                seekers bend themselves into a pretzel trying to win approval. I
                snapped. If you can&rsquo;t sell, you will be someone
                else&rsquo;s &ldquo;bitch&rdquo;. And I really mean it in that
                way. It means if we can&rsquo;t get our own work, we will be
                dependent on someone else to find work for us, which gives them
                more power in the relationship. And in most cases (I&rsquo;d say
                7 people out of 10) those people who bring us work will exploit
                that relationship, use it to their advantage.
              </p>

              <p></p>

              <p>
                This is just one representation of the many conversations I have
                had centered around this concept so I ask you this, what is your
                DREAM?
              </p>

              <p></p>

              <p>
                My time traveling has let me see what is possible and truly how
                many options there are, my recommendation is to decide on a
                fulfilling goal and don&rsquo;t forget to enjoy the journey
                along the way.
              </p>

              <p></p>

              <p></p>

              <p>
                Travel matters not because of the places you&rsquo;ll go and the
                things you&rsquo;ll do. Travel matters because of the
                experiences you&rsquo;ll have, the people you&rsquo;ll come
                across, the feelings that will come over you, and the lessons
                you&rsquo;ll learn that simply don&rsquo;t come from being the
                city you call home on a daily basis.
