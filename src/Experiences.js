              <p>
                Connecting with consumers on an emotional level is key,
                campaigns with purely emotional content performed about twice as
                well (31% vs. 16%) with only rational content, and those that
                were purely emotional did a little better (31% vs 26%) those
                that mixed emotional and rational content. Pringle and Field
                attribute this split to our brain’s ability to process emotional
                input without cognitive processing as well as our brain’s more
                powerful recording of emotional stimuli.

              <p>
                Consumers are not merely buying a product to satisfy their need
                but the use of a product also represents what the owner values
                and it becomes an extension of the owner. Marketing plays a
                vital function in the consumer goods industry as differentiation
                on product function or specification appears futile to the
                consumers through advertisement. Advertising in the category of
                consumer goods industry increasingly relies on emotional appeal
                seeking to connect with the norms and values of the customers.
              </p>

              <p>
                Marketers are able to manipulate consumers to make irrational
                decisions by playing on their emotions. Identifying specific
                emotions to target can be found in the experiences that these
                individuals have. Being someone that has an interest in
                multicultural marketing I am developing an understanding of the
                different experiences that come with the various cultures.
                Although every individual experiences life in different ways
                there are some universal experiences-with varying degrees.
                Universal experiences are registered in the deepest levels of
                each person, and as well, it also becomes an integral part of
                the collective memory, or consciousness, of humanity. Yes,
                Humanity HAS a collective consciousness, which consists of the
                experiences of every human being that has ever lived on this
                earth. The scheme of life is for an evolving expression of life.
                As experience is gathered, so does the ability of the “group
                soul” which is responsible for that life form. As the
                experiences accumulate as a result of all those lives lived, so
                does the ability for these forces to project more complex life
                forms. So, the levels of intelligence responsible for the
                projection of what was to become the most complex expression of
                life on this planet gradually accumulated enough wisdom and
                experience to project a more advanced form of primate. Then, as
                the experience grew, more and more advanced expressions of life
                forms became possible, until, eventually, the present form of
                humanity was possible.
              </p>

              <p>
                Why do you think the remarkable growth of technology and science
                has been possible in such a short time?
              </p>

              <p>
                Well, every human being that has ever existed has played a part
                in it all. Yes, every human being. As a result of pain and
                suffering, joy and pleasure, the lessons and experiences have
                been registered in the race memory of the overall group soul
                responsible for humanity. Naturally this is also filtered back
                to yet higher levels of intelligence, and eventually backs to
                the Planetary Source, the Solar Source, then the level of
                intelligence responsible for the Galaxy. And, eventually back to
                the Universal Source. Who knows, there may be (and probably are)
                even higher levels of intelligence, but that is a matter of
                discussion at another time and another place.
              </p>

              <p>
                But let us not be distracted from the issue at hand. As a result
                of the accumulated experiences of humanity for the relatively
                short period of time it has existed (in universal terms), the
                experience has accumulated to a sufficient level for the next
                evolutionary step to take place. We live at a critical time of
                change on our planet. The rate of vibration has to increase to
                accommodate the more advanced energies of the coming new age.
              </p>

              <p>
                We have to learn how to accommodate these subtler, yet more
                powerful energies. We have to appreciate the fact that as these
                new energies are very powerful, they may not always benefit all
                of the present form of humanity. Let our lives make a difference
                for future generations, prepare ourselves, now, for a new level
                of self awareness and enlightenment. Reach out for a level of
                understanding, which will change our understanding, and
                enjoyment of life. The importance for marketers to understand
                and identify these experiences will be critical as the
                multicultural population increases.
