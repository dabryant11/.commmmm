              I think this quote does a good job of explaining why I decided to
              embark on this journey 9 months ago. When I left the States last
              summer I was unsure as to where I would be living other than that
              it would be somewhere in China. Living abroad is something that I
              have wanted to do, this fellowship combined my athletic background
              and helped build the foundation of my professional career. Asia
              but China more specifically is a place that can open the mind of
              an individual and alter their global perception given a positive
              attitude. As a member of the inaugural class, the fellowship
              aligned with my decisions throughout life centered on my goals of
              being in an environment with others who value travel and different
              cultures.
            </p>
            <p>
              Throughout my life I have been passionate about contributing
              cultural understanding to those around me by using my knowledge
              from my academic career and personal experiences. I had hoped that
              this fellowship would enrich my current education and career
              experiences while giving me an opportunity to promote cultural
              understanding in China through the game of American Football,
              which opened up many opportunities for me in my life. In essence,
              this fellowship abled me to build on the life changing experience
              I previously had while studying abroad in China and continued to
              build a solid foundation for my professional career. Likewise, by
              continuing my cultural education this fellowship abled me to
              spread my newfound insight and knowledge to further educate people
              around me.
            </p>
            <p>
              My time abroad established a solid foundation for my career so
              that others may view me as someone that is willing to take
              calculated risks for personal and professional growth by spending
              extensive time abroad in an emerging economic power such as China.
              I&rsquo;m hopeful that China will continue to be featured in my
              future plans weather I continue to live abroad or return for
              business. I am confident that I will return to China, it is just a
              matter of when and for how long.

            <p>
              My understanding of identifying myself as an American has changed
              so that I am more appreciative of the freedoms that we have as
              Americans that are often taken for granted. It made me believe
              even more that as Americans, we should take full advantage of the
              power of our passports and ability to travel in comparison to
              other countries. My time in China increased my feelings that
              Americans need to spend time abroad so that we do not lose our
              ability to relate to the rest of the world. Hopefully, my time
              abroad will inspire friends and family to become more
              knowledgeable of other cultures and prevent them from asking some
              of the silly questions I received living abroad. Chinese could
              easily use the limited internet access and passport restrictions
              as an excuse for some of the benign, yet racial comments they
              make. In some cases, however, I met people that knew more about
              America then I did. The large population of China has taught me
              not to confuse a few situations with a generalization, which is
              how most stereotypes start.
            </p>
            <p>
              My understanding of Asia has changed showing not only the vast
              differences in the region, but the many nuances within China.
              Although I spent most of my time in Zhuhai, I was able to explore
              other Asian countries during the fellowship, and despite spending
              less time in those countries I was able to pick up on some
              cultural differences. Within China, I was able to travel as well
              and I begun to understand cultural differences among the many
              provinces and even in Guangdong.
            </p>

            <p>WORK</p>
            <img width="460px" src={factory} />
            <p>
              One of the most enjoyable and beneficial opportunities from my
              work placement was the chance to do factory tours throughout China
              with my colleagues and the Supply Chain Director of one of our
              clients. Most people in the States often think of child labor and
              the many other jokes that come with Chinese factories. The
              environments I observed for most of these workers was not
              something that I personal would enjoy living in but I believe
              would not align with most Americans perceptions. Since these
              factories are spread out and specialize in various products I was
              able to visit Chinese cities that many people would have no other
              reason to visit such as Ningbo, Taizhou and Fuzhou. Although these
              factories did not fit the common joke among Americans about
              factory labor I couldn&rsquo;t help but question my perceptions of
              factory labor. I was curious if this people are happy with the
              work they&rsquo;re doing but even if they are not is this
              different from the man or woman making six figures from a job that
              they unhappy with. I couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder when seeing
              these people in factories is this something they dreamed for but
              if not how did it end up like this, a lack of resources or perhaps
              a limited perspective abled them to see other possibilities for a
              career. My time in China showed me how many possibilities in life
              they are so I think this experience put me in a better position by
              broadening my perspective.
            </p>
            <p>
              This thought begun to snowball and got me thinking about those in
              other countries and even about myself and how my life could have
              been had I not had my perspective broaden through travel. The
              living situation of some people that I met in China might not be
              something I would want for myself. However seeing what might be
              considered as unfair to somewhere fresh of the plane goes hand in
              hand with the perspective of an individual within the country and
              the different expectations of someone abroad or visiting and not
              fully understanding the culture. There are so many lessons I
              learned from this experience but the biggest one would be learning
              more about people and how their aspirations and business ventures
              affect their interpersonal relationships. Learning more about
              people in general was one of my biggest takeaways.

            <p>Language Learning</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              &ldquo;You must understand that a foreign language is just basic
              knowledge&rdquo;
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              This was a quote that I saw in a museum in Asia, I think it does a
              good job of conveying the attitude towards language learning of
              some of the countries that I have visited. Although a fair portion
              of non-US citizens view it as such a wonderful place this attitude
              towards language learning is something that I believe as Americans
              we fall short, perhaps because of the versatility of English.
              However I believe the knowledge of a foreign language opens up new
              doors to an individual, not only does it improve someone as a job
              prospect but enables them to become more cultural understanding
              and understand the many nuances of other cultures that often get
              lost in translation.

            <p>
              The other fellows and I were brought in to help raise the level of
              the league and a large part of that was player development.
              Although we haven&rsquo;t reached SEC caliber athletics I have
              been pleased and excited with the level of growth and appreciation
              from my players in Guangzhou. Our annual party is something that
              made me reflect on the growth that not only our team is having as
              athletes but the individuals as well.
            </p>
            <p>
              Having an instant connection with a portion of the local Chinese
              community is something that I viewed as the most significant from
              this fellowship. Moving to a new city without knowing anybody is
              something that can be difficult especially when you factor in a
              language barrier, cultural differences and with the Chinese
              community being difficult for foreigners to break into. Having the
              connection of sport is something that I would compare to the
              universal language of music and having the credibility of being a
              former collegiate athlete gave me the ability to effectively
              command my team in Guangzhou. I was able to harness this
              connection that grew over time to delve into both modern and
              historic Chinese culture, this is something that I hold in high
              regard. I was able to have experiences that may have taken some
              people years to have living in China or perhaps not at all. These
              experiences helped me learn more about people in general. Living
              in a different culture emphasized not only the differences, but
              also similarities in human behavior.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although I believe I had an impact on my team there were
              definitely obstacles that I had to face like achieving any goal,
              even more unique obstacles when trying to achieve quality American
              football in China.
            </p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              Some of the biggest things I learned from American football were
              the aspect of family and discipline. Upon my arrival to Guangzhou
              I was met with a team that lacked discipline and a feeling of
              family. American football has taught me how valuable discipline is
              and how doing the little things right or not can lead to success
              or to failure. I encouraged players on the team to spend time with
              each other off the field whether it be eating together or playing
              video games to help build the family aspect of the team. Given my
              location in Zhuhai this wasn&rsquo;t something I was able to fully
              initiate during the week but I would go out with my team after
              practice for lunch before returning to Zhuhai. This development of
              a family atmosphere led to more accountability amongst the time
              and limited the amount of micro managing I had to do compared to
              the early time in my fellowship. The family atmosphere that I
              associate with American football pushed me to do things that at
              the time thought I was incapable of doing but because of the
              support of my &ldquo;brothers&rdquo; I was able to conquer these
              obstacles. This was something I witnessed first hand with my time
              with the Guangzhou Apaches whether it being a player getting over
              a fear of beating press coverage or studying for their English
              exam so they can study abroad in the US they were able to beat
              these obstacles because of their support group.
            </p>
            <p>
              During my fellowship I often questioned myself as to my level of
              impact on the team especially living 2 hours away but my final
              game with the team all my doubts were removed, seeing the growth
              of my players on and off the field. Whether it be the player that
              got over his fear over tackling or the shy player that became more
              vocal with the team. One of my biggest takeaways from the final
              game was during most of my time with the team I didn&rsquo;t get
              the impression that they were having fun playing the game. However
              in the final game I saw the shift in having fun playing the game
              of American football and the family aspect of players celebrating
              together after good plays whether it be shaking hands or slapping
              each other on the helmet. This game was something that almost did
              not happen but we were able to organize it as part of the South
              China Championship Series and I am very glad we did as it provided
              me with visual evidence of the impact I had on the team.
            </p>
            <img width="460px" src={huddle} /> <p>Conclusion</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>
              One the biggest things I valued during this fellowship compared to
              my previous time in China was the length of stay, which abled me
              to really delve into the cultural although there is still more to
              be explored. For those that have traveled around China or have
              some knowledge about China might understand the many differences
              within the country. For those that don&rsquo;t know about the
              level of complexities within the country this can be summed up by
              people that ask if someone speaks &ldquo;Chinese&rdquo; as appose
              to do you speak Mandarin/Cantonese? There are many differences
              among the different provinces in China and language is just one of
              them, this has been quite interesting to experience first hand.
            </p>
            <p>
              My assessment of the China Gridiron Fellowship is positive with
              there being a lot of potential to be explored. Orientation was one
              of the most exciting times for me meeting so many people from
              various industries. This is an aspect that I wish would have been
              more prevalent during my fellowship but perhaps would have seen
              more opportunities being in a bigger city. The fellow selection
              process is something that went smooth and visa runs were fairly
              easily given my location to Macau. Being immersed for nine months
              in a culture that&rsquo;s different from my own, there are many
              key insights and reflections but the biggest is the irony and
              hypercriticism among people because it appears that they have lost
              themselves in the presumptions of a superior culture, ideology
              etc. Overall things were not always perfect, but neither is life
              and I believe that one cannot have growth without struggle and the
              bad makes you appreciate the good. I have no regrets, this
              fellowship was a great experience and something someone else would
              be very fortunate to experience.
