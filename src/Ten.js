                As my time in China comes to a close I begin to reflect on the
                journey and recount some of the memorable moments that have
                taken place. Traveling has brought many life changing
                experiences but this list is a variety of experiences I&rsquo;ve
                had living in China.
              </p>
              <h2>1. Being in a Chinese movie </h2>
              <img width="460px" src={movie} />
              <p>
                This was something that happened completely by accident but who
                knows maybe it leads to an acting career&#8230;but more
                realistically probably not. I think this incident speaks to the
                amount of opportunities here compared to the States. Granted
                this was specifically for film but I think it services as
                somewhat of a representation to the other opportunities
                here&#8230;well at least if you&rsquo;re a foreigner.
              </p>
              <p>
                2. Playing basketball with locals This was something I mentioned
                in a previous blog but this is still some of my favorite
                experiences living in China. Although I am not the best shooter
                this was an excellent time to have interactions with locals and
                help reduce some stereotypes.
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <p>
                &ldquo;However after a few games and seeing my low shooting
                percentage I can&rsquo;t help but feel like I broke some
                stereotypes (that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m here for
                right?).&rdquo; &ndash; Darien Bryant (Bridging the Gap)

              <h2>3. Migration of Chinese New Year </h2>
              <img width="460px" src={gz} />

              <p>
                China was an adjustment for various reasons but living most of
                my life in relatively small cities the large population was a
                big one. This was compounded during Chinese New Year, a shocking
                statistic from this year&rsquo;s holiday is around 2.5 billion
                trips on the road were expected to be taken, along with 332
                million trips by train and 55 million through the air. This type
                of congestion led to many delays and some logistical issues.
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <h2>4. New Year&rsquo;s Eve in Hong Kong </h2>
              <img width="460px" src={nye} />
              <p>
                As maybe most Americans do, I associate the New Year celebration
                with New York because I often saw the ball dropping in Times
                Square on television so I became interested in having the
                celebration in a big city.
              </p>
              <h2>5. Touring Factories </h2>

              <img width="460px" src={factory} />

              <p>
                Most people in the States often think of child labor and the
                many other jokes that come with Chinese factories. The
                environments I observed for most of these workers is not
                something that I personal would enjoy living in but I believe
                would not align with most Americans perceptions. Since these
                factories are spread out and specialize in various products I
                was able to visit Chinese cities that many people would have no
                other reason to visit such as Ningbo, Taizhou and Fuzhou.
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <p>
                Although these factories did not fit the common joke among
                Americans about factory labor I couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder
              </p>
              <p>
                Are these people happy with their work? How many people in other
                countries are truly happy with their work? How different this
                is? Is this what they dreamed for? If not how did it up like
                this?{" "}
              </p>
              <h2> 6. Coaching in 3 languages</h2>
              <img width="460px" src={practice} />
              <p>
                With this being my first time of officially having a coaching
                position there has been many challenges that occur like any
                other learning curve. I studied a little bit of Mandarin during
                my time at University but now living in Guangdong province
                I&rsquo;ve begun to learn some Cantonese. Although my team is
                comprised mostly of Chinese we have one Russian player who I
                often speak with in English but I mostly speak Cantonese for the
                locals and Mandarin for the few Chinese we have from other
                provinces, the switching between languages is something that
                constantly keeps me on my toes.
              </p>
              <h2>7. Player Development </h2>
              <img width="460px" src={banquet} />

              <p>
                {" "}
                Almost everyone is surprised when I tell him or her that I coach
                American Football in China, which is understandable. The
                question that often follows after what I do here is&#8230;are
                they any good? Although we haven&rsquo;t reached SEC caliber
                athletics I have been pleased and excited with the level of
                growth and appreciation from my players in Guangzhou. Our recent
                annual party is something that made me reflect on the growth
                that not only our team is having but the individuals as well.
              </p>
              <p></p>
              <p>
                These last 3 could possibly be listed as one but I&rsquo;ve
                decided to separate them to show a representation as to how much
                of an impact these types of experiences have had on my time
                living in China.
              </p>
              <h2> 8. Meeting diverse people </h2>
              <p>
                My time here as led me to such a diverse group of people not
                just foreigners but various types of Chinese, old and young,
                Cantonese and those from other parts of China. A growing theme
                from my blog posts is that more people should travel abroad
                whether it be for work, study abroad or even vacation and if I
                had to pick one reason why this would be it. Meeting these
                diverse people help you become more understanding and then you
                can share this new information and perspective with others. This
                is part of the reason I&rsquo;m writing these blogs is so that
                those that may not have the ability to travel for whatever
                reason they experience some of this to an extent and inspire
                them to travel when possible. Meeting people from all over the
                world and hearing their stories and what brought them to China
                has been a bonus.
              </p>
              <h2>9. Befriending a local Chinese family.</h2>
              <img width="460px" src={music} />
              <p>
                This is something I&rsquo;m very grateful because it happened
                completely by chance and introduced me into some of the
                intricacies of Chinese culture on a more personal level from the
                perception of various generations. I became friends with a man
                over the love of drums and was introduced to his family and
                other family friends.
              </p>
              <h2>10. Learning Chinese culture</h2>
              <p>
                For those that have traveled around China or have some knowledge
                about China might understand the many differences within the
                country. For those that don&rsquo;t know about the level of
                complexities within the country this can be summed up by people
                that ask if someone speaks &ldquo;Chinese&rdquo; as appose to do
                you speak Mandarin/Cantonese? There are many differences among
                the different provinces in China and language is just one of
                them, this has been quite interesting to experience first hand.

                Overall as my time here comes to a close things have not always
                been perfect but I believe that one cannot have growth without
                struggle and the bad makes you appreciate the good.
